We sometimes come across young kittens who need to be fostered until they are up to weight for spay/neuter and adoption (2 lbs.=about 2 months). Some may be \"bottle babies\" some may be young, but semi-feral, needing socialization; Are you experienced with this, or willing to be trained?<br><br>Note: The kittens in this photos have already been fostered in an ACP homes. They are NOT currently available for adoption.<br><br>\nACP also often has a particular need for foster parents for semi-feral juvenile or young adult cats. This may require patience and technique to work with the cat to gain their trust and teach them to appreciate human contact, so that they can be eventually adopted as pets.

I guess its true- having come from a background without human contact, I have discovered how much I love people.

Please contact the Foster Care Hotline at 206-684-0685 to arrange a meeting. Thank you! My foster mom likes to refer to me as the \"Comeback Kid\". My original sweet nature was temporarily hidden by my fears from being raised outside without human contact. But with time and patient foster parents I have joyfully reclaimed my naturally curious, happy, and playful personality. I have been called \"drop-dead gorgeous\" with my medium length tortie coat and striking markings. Also, I am quite the aerialist when it comes to playtime with my favorite feather toy, then I like to settle into a warm lap for cuddles and brushing. I am very bonded with my sweet, handsome brother, Licorice. Like our names imply, we would like to stick together if at all possible. I also dream of a fairly quiet home so that I can continue to build confidence and learn to trust my adoptive family completely. I am a good eater and have perfect litterbox habits. Are you the one to whom I can devote myself forever? CARING FOR CATS: In addition to yearly vet visits, cats require proper nutrition, fresh water, and clean, well-located litter boxes (at least one litter box per cat). If litter box issues arise, call a vet ASAP to rule out anything medical; most issues are easily resolved with a few small adjustments. Cat claws can be carefully trimmed as needed, but we discourage declawing because it can cause serious health and behavioral issues. Familiarity with common household hazards can go a long way in keeping cats safe. Statistically, indoor cats live longer than outdoor cats and tend to have less medical expenses. Some cats would enjoy having safe access to the outdoors, either on a leash and harness, with supervision, or in an enclosed area - however, many cats can live happily and successfully as indoor only pets. To reduce the chance of boredom and depression, cats should have a stimulating environment. Cats enjoy cozy places to relax and look out windows, high perches for surveying, a sturdy scratching post (appropriate places to scratch are a must), boxes or beds to hide in so they feel safe, catnip, cat grass, food puzzles, and toys. Cats also need daily exercise with interactive playtime. Tiring them out before bed (with a snack to follow) can help ensure everyone gets a better nights sleep.  Newly adopted cats will need time to adjust to their surroundings. Patience and compassion will help ease the transition. With good care and lots of love, cats can live 15 or more years.

    "description": "**Important Note** You won't find this kitty at the shelter. This kitty is waiting patiently in foster care for your call. Please contact the Foster Care Hotline at 206-684-0685 to arrange a meeting. Thank you! Rob Roy is a sweet young, energetic boy who loves to run and play. If you throw a treasured toy across the room he will gladly chase after it and then entertain you with some one-cat soccer. He loves to climb and explore or dart across the tile floor and slide under the sofa to retrieve a lost toy. Have dust bunnies in hard to reach places? Rob Roy will gladly find them for you and pull them out into the open! Favorite toys include the laser, shadows, and a small soft ball filled with catnip. Though timid at first and hesitant to be pet, Rob Roy enjoys human companionship and especially likes to follow you around the house and observe all you do. He is particularly attuned to meal times , eager to remind you when it's time to be fed. Rob Roy is not a clingy cat but once he feels comfortable, will happily snuggle at your feet as you're waking up in the morning! Rob Roy adores other cats and would find himself quite lonely without a patient older brother or sister to play with and continue his studies in all things feline. He would do best in a somewhat quite home with both people and cats willing to play with him. Older kids, or patient younger children, should be OK. Rob Roy has been treated for a gastrointestinal condition in the past and needs a guardian who can commit to always feeding him a particular grain-free diet to keep him healthy. This food is easily found at local pet stores or vet offices [or possibly on line where it might be cheaper?]. In return for this minimal care, he will make a handsome, healthy, and entertaining companion.",

    "description": "Meet Ashley, a beautiful 5-month-old gray and white girl! Ashley is a very resilient and brave girl. As a kitten, she lost vision as a kitten due to glaucoma so the vet team removed her eyes to make her more comfortable. And is she ever! Ashley is super affectionate and loving but is a true kitten in every sense of the word. She gets along well with the dog in her foster home and she'd probably like to have animal friends to keep her company. Ashley will need to be an indoor-only cat because she's blind. However, having a blind cat isn't very different from having any other cat. Blind cats often do best when furniture isn't rearranged frequently. Ashley is a playful and sweet girl excited and ready to meet her new family! Ashley is staying in a foster home while she waits for her new family. If you'd like to meet her, please contact our adoption team at 425.649.7563 or adoption@seattlehumane.org! Ashley is spayed, microchipped and vaccinated. All of our cats have been tested for Feline Leukemia/FIV and go home with a certificate for an examination by a King County veterinarian and their very own identification tag and collar.

She has been wormed and flea treated.\n\nHistory: Jorie comes from another local rescue. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. \n\nNotes from Jorie's Foster Home:\n\nLittle Jorie is the sweetest and the most feminine little kitty I've met.She is fairly reserved as in a little shy if her surroundings become too busy; she prefers to observe from the sidelines, if at all.  She is not into racing and chasing....it's as though she regards it as \"unladylike\".   Jorie does love her cat tree; climbing high to watch the birds, napping or an occasional tango with a hanging toy.\n\nIn the evenings, when the fur kids are quietly hanging out, watching TV or sleeping, Jorie comes along and joins pups and kitties alike, in my lap so she can gather up her fair share of love!!!  She is VERY affectionate.  She will climb on you like a cat tree....back of the chair behind your head, on your head, your shoulders...all while purring quite loudly, to the tune of some dance routine only she can see or hear.\n\nDuring the day when she's not sleeping on the basket of laundry, I'm most apt to find her sleeping upstairs on my bed.  Jorie's favorite friend is my older cat, Tomas.  Tomas is my 15 lb. retired farm cat and mouser who is also not interested in the teenage play of \"catch me if you can\", racing up and down the stairs.  I often see him lazing about on the bed washing Jorie's face.\n\nJorie is one who would shine her brightest as an only kitten with an adult kitty friend or maybe a teenage friend that is also happier living the mellower life, much like herself.  I believe Jorie would love playing as long as her mate was not as rambunctious as her current housemates!  She would also feel very blessed if her new home included a nice, high kitty tree.  :) \n\n{ Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the cat's foster home. Although PUP provides adopters up to the minute information on our cats, we cannot guarantee they will behave in the same manner in a different environment with new owners. } \n\nAdoption: If you think you have room in your home and heart for this dog and you reside within Washington State, please go to our Adoption Information page. There you will find more information and be able to fill out an adoption application.  http://www.pupdogrescue.org/adopt.html",

    "description": "* Male Domestic Shorthair mix<br><br>* Approximately 5 1/2 months old\n* Approximately 4 lbs.\n* Litterbox trained\n* Okay with other cats\n* Okay with dogs\n* Dog respectful children 8 and older\n* Adoption fee: $75<br><br>Raising a kitten requires a lot of work and is a commitment! Pipin will be an awesome addition to a family that can give him the attention, exercise, training and affection he deserves.\n\nHealth: Pipin has been neutered and microchipped. He is current on his vaccines and tested negative for Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). He has been wormed and flea treated.\n\nHistory: Pipin comes from an overcrowded shelter in California. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. All dogs and cats PUP pulls from California come with health certificates, as required by Washington state.\n\nNotes from Pipin's Foster Home:\n\nPipin is a little guy for his age but you will soon fall in love with his uniqueness.  From his wide eyed, expressive, huge, orange eyes to his lovely, silky, soft, beige, tiger stripe coat an white bib!!  He is adorable and oh, so affectionate!! \n\nPipin is very playful and tries very hard to keep up with the big boys with all the playing.  He loves talking to you, rubbing on you and climbing on you. He is well litter box trained and gets along well with the dogs as long as they are kitty friendly and not into chasing. \n\nPipin is a little shy when he first meets someone, dog or human; however, his curiosity soon wins out!! Pipin is especially friend when he knows you're otherwise engaged...and will quickly want up on your lap...then down...then up...and so on. \n\nPipin has not been around any children but he has been around my caged birds.  He quickly learned not to walk or sit on the cage tops.  Conures are small parrots that have painful nips!!  So he's pretty much content to just observe.  :-).  Pipin is a sweet little guy and will make a happy addition to his new, loving family. \n{ Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the cat's foster home.

He almost scratched my doorknob off in my bathroom and was meowing so loud at night that I would bring him into my bedroom at night. I would wake up to him curled up on my bed and each day he got closer and now snuggles right beside me. He is extremely curious and loves to watch/follow my other cat and really loves chasing toys around (preferably balls that roll and jingle). His purr is one of the loudest I've heard and you don't have to be petting him to hear it. He starts to purr as soon as he is in the presence of people/kitties. He also loves food and comes running each time I feed him, and loves dried salmon treats. He should be adopted with his sister, Toffee.We are open for adoptions Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday from 12-7. <br><br>If the cat in in a foster home, we are happy to arrange an appointment.

He does climb so he needs to be in a safe, free of high climbing surfaces, and attentive home.  Emmet will need to be inddors only, fed a high quality diet with canned and dry food, and NO de-clawing is allowed.

They are always exploring, playing, cuddling, and practically purr just thinking someone might come into the room.  Their mother was seen jumping out of a trailer that was being moved from one junk yard to another.  At the new location, two tiny kittens were found hiding under the trash.  These girls were instantly happy with whatever life had given them despite the sad beginnings.  Now they are looking and waiting for a great home to appreciate all the love they have to give!  Micah and Kelby are not Cat Tales cats but are being posted as a courtesy for another rescuer. <br><br>If you would like to meet Micah and Kelby please email fortheloveofcush@gmail.com.\nUpdate from their foster mom, straight from the girls' mouths....<br><br>Hi! How are you doing?! We know it's not really the right forum in which to ask, but we're just such polite girls that we couldn't resist, and we absolutely love making new friends! You should also probably know that we'v  been told that we're the best kind of friends to have because we can make anyone smile (no matter what kind of day they've had) with our infectiously happy and enthusiastic personalities and affinities for snuggles.  We can liven up even the most boring tasks with our always interested presence and selfless offers of assistance, and we pretty much radiate sunshine with our gentle but loud purrs, prances with tails raised, and soft head bonks. So, if you're looking for two new best friends who were born with the ability to make every one of your days better just by being ourselves, our foster family is pretty sure the slogan \"who rescued who?\" was written with us in mind!  Please email fortheloveofcush@gmail.com to find out more about us!\n\nP.S. We're about 7-months-old, spayed, vaccinated, FIV/FeLV tested, microchipped, and litterbox trained!",

Oasis got a call from a nice couple who found a litter of kittens under a tarp that was covering the cushion on their deck swing! Oasis went over and gathered up the kittens and also found their mom, Angel, who is also available for adoption. Jimmie and his litter mates were about 5 weeks old and were all brought inside, where Angel raised them. Jimmie is one of 5 kittens and really loves his litter mates. Jimmie would do best if adopted into the same home with one of his litter mates to play with. Kittens do best if they have a buddy to play with. Jimmie gets along well with everyone, but will be shy of new surroundings at first. He requires a family that will give him lots of attention and time to adjust. When adopting a kitten, the human family needs to understand that kittens are active and get into mischief, plus they do require lots of time, attention and patience. It's also necessary to understand that kittens will need the time to adjust to the new situation. Jimmie is a cute boy, with glossy black fur, with a touch of white and big round eyes. Adopting an animal is a lifetime commitment, so please do not adopt until you can make that commitment. Jimmie is neutered, vaccinated, flea treated and wormed. If you are interested in adopting him, please fill out and submit our on-line application, which is on our website at www.oasisforanimals.org or let us know if you have any questions. We are located on the south end of Whidbey Island, about 15 minutes from the ferry landing in Clinton.

    "description": "Marnie is one of 3 sweet babies born to a gentle stray mom, who gave birth in an old child's playhouse. Oasis got a call from a kind couple, after they found the tiny babies inside the playhouse. We rescued mom and her kittens and brought them safely inside. Marnie and her siblings were raised by their mom in a wonderful foster home. Their mom also accepted another litter of orphaned kittens as her own and raised them too!  Marnie loves to play with his litter mates, as well as other kittens and playful young cats. She likes to cuddle and sleep with at least one other kitten and we often find them in a big pile! Marnie would do best if adopted into a home with one of her litter mates, or another kitten. Kittens do best if they have a buddy to play and snuggle with - especially when the adopter is away at work. Marnie is a young playful kitten, who may be a bit shy of new situations and as is typical of most kittens, should be given time to adjust to a new situation. If you adopt Marnie and hopefully a litter mate or another kitten, they will need time to adjust to the new situation. Then be prepared for lots of fun, affection and action! Marnie loves cat toys & canned food! If you adopt her, you will be very fortunate. It's necessary for adopters to understand that kittens will need some time to adjust and learn about their new family. Marnie is a cute black/brown kitten, with just a bit of white on her chest. Adopting an animal is a lifetime commitment, so please do not adopt until you can make that commitment. Marnie is spayed, been vaccinated twice, flea treated and wormed. If you are interested in adopting her, and perhaps a litter mate, please fill out and submit our on-line application, which is on our website at www.oasisforanimals.org or let us know if you have any questions.

The kind woman, who lived next door was concerned about them and called Oasis to help rescue the three babies. So, Oasis supplied the traps and she watched the traps. We were able to capture all 3 kittens, as well as their mom and dad. All of the kittens, plus the parents were spayed/neutered and given vaccinations. The baby kittens were unsure of humans, but with patience, kindness and attention, they have come a very long way.

Rambo is a young kitten, who is playful, and as is typical of most kittens, will need time to adjust to a new situation. He loves to eat - both canned and dry food! If you adopt him, you will be very fortunate. It's necessary for adopters to understand that kittens will need some time to adjust and learn about their new family. Rambo is a handsome boy, with short brown tabby fur and gold eyes. Adopting an animal is a lifetime commitment, so please do not adopt until you can make that commitment. Rambo is neutered, vaccinated, flea treated and wormed. If you are interested in adopting him, please fill out and submit our on-line application, which is on our website at www.oasisforanimals.org or let us know if you have any questions. We are located on the south end of Whidbey Island, about 15 minutes from the ferry landing in Clinton. We normally take cats to various locations on the mainland on the weekends for adoption, so please just ask or check our Facebook page. Thank you for adopting homeless, rescued kitties!",

Bingo had been the only kitten in the home for a few weeks, but he is a baby and could get used to other kittens after he gets to know them.

Originally, Boba's Mom, Melrose and her siblings Modesto, Bel-Air, Fontana, and Wilshire were brought to a local shelter as their owner had too many animals. Boba is a little on the shy side, but we know with love and time she will thrive. Once Boba knows her people, she'll purr like a lion when being pet and loves her back scratched. And she'll be happy to engage with you in play - in particular with her favorite wand toys. She has not lived with cats or dogs, so we think she would prefer to be a single girl. She would hide from kids, so she is looking for a quiet, adult only home. Once she's comfortable, she'll happily hang out on your lap.

A kind hearted student heard him meowing and rescued him, bringing him to the shelter. He was just a little guy then, thought to be only about 2 months old. Now about five months old, Oliver is a rather shy kitten and is looking for a special owner who will give him lots of time and space. He will allow special people that he considers friends to hold and pet him and rewards them with a nice purr. He seems to like the other kittens and adult cats at the cat center so would probably enjoy having a feline friend. A good looking little fellow, if you look closely at Oliverâs coat, you will see tabby stripes. - See more at: http://www.waifanimals.org/cats/oliver/#sthash.HeOfIzfc.dpuf",

Please note: The picture above is a stock photo.<br><br>Thank you for your interest in foster kittens! \nKittens who are in our foster care program are generally kittens who arrived at the humane society as unweaned orphans , were still nursing, or were not old or big enough to be placed up for adoption. These kittens would not have survived in a stressful shelter environment. Our foster care program provides care and comfort for animals with special needs in private homes of our trained volunteer foster care providers. \nOnce the kittens are old enough (usually 6-8 weeks) and weigh enough to be spayed or neutered (2 lbs), they return to the shelter for adoption. Call the shelter at (360) 733-2080 to inquire about available kittens. \nPlease note that we do not place âholdsâ on animals until youâve met them in person, even if youâve filled out an application and expressed interest in a specific animal. This is because we want to ensure that each animal is a good fit for the interested party, and that the interested party is a good fit for the animal. We try to set each adoption up for success, for both the animals and for the people.  \nThe kittens would love to meet you! Do you feel the same? Please fill out an adoption application (here or at either shelter) and turn it in to Emily Wyss the foster care coordinator via email at foster@whatcomhumane.org, or fax it to 360.733.4746. Our adoption counselors will help you figure out if you're right for each other.<br><br>Questions about foster kittens in general or other foster animals?

Sheldon is a bit playful but would rather cuddle, and it will take him a bit longer to warm up to someone new. But as long as his brother is by his side he is fine. I can't keep them out of water. They love the water and Leonard will actually try to jump in the tub with you. Sheldon is a talker who lives up to his name and is always complaining. They were named after characters in the show the Big Bang Theory. Sheldon has shorter hair and is lighter colored. <br><br>\nThey are good with other cats. They are good with little dogs 27 pounds or smaller which is what they are used to.

    "description": "Stevie is a lovely male kitten who is blind. We are guessing his birthdate is in the first week of August 2015. He was born into a feral colony on a farm, and was one of a litter of five, all of his siblings being orange tabbies. Stevie is a long-haired cat, and although his coat started as solid black, it has been developing a very distinctive black smoke colour. Stevie has been neutered and vaccinated.<br><br>Stevie had his eyes removed when he was nearly three months old as a result of a combination of glaucoma and infection. Other than the eyes, he has been very healthy. His personality is amazing. He is both fun and funny, and outgoing. Although he had to be in screaming pain for most of his life, he never stopped purring and playing. After his eye surgery, he came out of the anaesthetic and immediately started to play with the vet techs. <br><br>\nStevie loves to explore on his own and does not need anyone to move him to a new space - he can find his way just fine. He jumps and plays just like a cat who can see. Until he knows the distance, he backs down off the couch or chair, but when he figures out the distance he will just jump. A paper bag is a great adventure for him (see video), and he loves to play with his ball as well. Stevieâs littermate, who is also up for adoption, is a good buddy to him, if anyone would be interested in the pair together.\n\nStevie will be able to lead an almost completely normal life, but he will need to be strictly indoor-only. He will need a fairly static environment - a home without clutter and that has furniture and things that are not moved around a lot. He will learn every inch of his new home and then will never bump into anything -- if nothing moves. He gets along well with the other kittens, cats, and dogs in his foster home. It would be nice if he could have an animal friend to enrich his life in his adoptive home, but we don't want his adoptive home to have very playful dogs or aggressive cats because of Stevie's obvious disadvantage. A suitable adoptive home will not have family members younger than teenagers. \n\nIt would be best if he could go to someone with experience with blind cats, but a motivated person could certainly learn how to care for him. His adoption will be subject to a $225 fee and a home visit. Please contact us at mbruce8@shaw.ca if you are interested in Stevie and tell us about yourself and the life you envision for him. \n\nYou can view a video of Stevie at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx3fubTdr2Q",

    "description": "*** Please note that the kittens in the photos are from previous years.  Please contact us to find out if we currently have any kittens available.  ***<br><br>When we have kittens, our kittens don't live at the shelter. They're in foster homes and will be ready for adoption once they're weaned.  If you are interested, please complete the standard pre-adopt form on our web site. We can arrange for you to meet the babies so you can pick out your new family member.<br><br>\nThe kittens will need to go to homes where they will have a cat friend to keep them company, to play with them and snooze with them while you're busy. It doesn't necessarily have to be another kitten (though that's ideal), as long as they will have a young feline friend. These are social critters who rely on games with feline pals to learn life skills. Those who grow up without feline company tend to lose the ability to relate to other cats and have a harder time adjusting to the presence of other cats later in life. They can also become overly dependent on you. We also ask that our kittens go to indoor homes for safety from traffic, predators, disease, poisons, and other dangers in the outside world.\n\nHaving a kitten is like having a toddler in the house. They'll get into everything and they can keep you up at night by scampering around or pouncing your moving toes under the blankets. You'll need patience and you'll need to kitten-proof your house. Cover the soil of your potted plants, hide delicate ornaments and jewelry, tie back your sheer drapes, keep the toilet lid down and check the washer and dryer before you turn them on. After a year or so, your rambunctious little monster will settle down and become a dignified, inscrutable feline who is content to spend long periods meditating and napping. He or she will need you for the next 15 to 20 years of a cat's life span. So consider where you might be 15 or 20 years from now and be sure your cat can still be with you. If you're ready to take on a furry baby, please contact us!",

However, his case is extreme and he is also bowel and bladder incontinent.<br><br>\nThis incontinence caused his people to bring him to be euthanized. The vet just could not euthanize a roly, poly, playful, purring baby (we are so very fortunate to work with so many kind, compassionate vets) so they asked us if we could help. Incontinent animals are a challenge from a practical perspective, and Beans will also need to be closely monitored as he will be susceptible to infections.\n\nWe donât know how long he will be with us, but he is here now.

Mr. Green came to us from another shelter and we donât have too much information on his past.  However we have been informed that he loves other felines and canines.  We figure Mr. Green will do best in a home where he has feline and/or canine companions to play with. <br><br>\nMr. Green is a sweet kid who like attention and snuggles.

They never scratch or bite. They may hiss when they first get to their new home, but I really doubt it. They have never had an accident once, they use their litter box neatly and diligently, they don't get into anything they shouldn't, and they don't scratch the furniture. Even if I accidentally leave their treats out (which they love), they will be exactly where I left them, untouched.<br><br>\nThese gorgeous girls LOVE to PLAY, and I have found it is the best way to engage and bond with them. They play on their own a bit too but especially like when I play with them. It's very sweet to see how aware these two are of each other and how they each let the other have their turn to play back and forth. It is very important that these two girls go to a home where someone will play with them every day. \n\nShay is starting to come around more, and clearly likes to be 'near the action' as long as it doesn't get to close. When she is in the mood-you'll be able to tell when she is very relaxed- she will let you scratch her under her chin and behind the ears and she obviously enjoys it, but can only handle so much. Once in a while she also lets you hold her. She will definitively get better and better as she gets more trusting, and I am sure she is going to be a love bug one day.\n\nTaya and Shay are bonded and must be adopted together.",

They were found together as tiny kittens living outside on their own. Luckily a nice woman scooped them up and took them in so they could have a chance at becoming part of someone's family.They are both sweet girls with beautiful loud purrs. Blackberry is the bolder of the two, seeking out attention and affection from her foster family while Peaches can be a bit more shy. While Peaches might be the shyer one she will reward you with snuggles and purrs once she feels safe in your lap. They love kids and do well with other cats. The have not been exposed to dogs yet. These two will be a wonderful addition to a family looking for sweetest kitties to snuggle up with.\nIf interested in meeting Blackberry and Peaches please contact Kelly at 503-810-8749 or khardin28@lycos.com",

    "description": "Are you an Introvert? Because I am and I need someone who understands me. Oh, I'm not shy! Once I get to know you, I am the most playful, mischievous and loving kitten. But I'm not one to put on a big show for total strangers, so I can't compete with other kittens that rush over to you right away. If you'll just take some time and understand my world, you might find that I am perfect kitty match for you.I live with three grown cats in my foster home, and I like them just fine. I'm not great with loud noises, so I'm a little scared of big men and loud kids. I am lovey and like your attention, but I'm not needy, so I can handle it if you are away during the day as long as you give me love and play time when you get home. Gidget can be viewed in her foster home in the NW Portland/Cedar Mill area.

Apple Cider is a very social and friendly kitten who likes to be held when she is not chasing and wrestling with her sister. She has been around her foster's dogs and adult cats and gets along fine with them. Apple Cider is a good eater and has excellent litter box habits. She is spayed and has had all her kitten shots. Like most kittens, she will be happiest in a home with another kitten or active cat or dog to play with. It would be perfect if she could find a forever home with her sister. They have very similar personalities and are a beautiful pair. AC has been in foster care with teenagers, but would probably be fine with younger children. She and her sister would love to join your family for the holidays & beyond.

The need is especially urgent as the weather heats up.\n\n\nCommitment is typically 2-8 weeks and requires a room where the mom and kittens can be separated from other household pets.  This might be a spare bedroom or even a good size bathroom.\n\n\nTo learn more, contact our Volunteer Program Assistant, Nancy Puro at 503-925-8803 or via email at nancyp@catadoptionteam.org.\n\n\nThank you for helping us save lives!\n\n\n*NOTE: The kittens pictured are all in their loving forever homes!  They were fostered by a great family until they were ready, and they are an example of the kittens you might foster.*",

He would do well in a home with other cats.\nCorben is a little timid of the big scary world and needs to be an inside only cat.  He wants to go to a quiet home.  He would do best in a home without children, as too much energy scares him.  He wants to spend his time either playing with other cats or curled up in your lap.",

    "description": "Meow Meows' mom was a feral cat that hung around. She was the only kitten from the litter. The mom abandoned her when she was just old enough to be weaned and it was noticed then that she had infection in both her eyes. She was one of the lucky ones in that the infection had mostly healed on its own. Unfortunately, she still suffered damage to both her eyes. Because she has limited vision, she's very skittish, and because of this will need to go to a home with no small children. In spite of her early set backs, Meow Meow has the sweetest personality and gentle meow once she warms up to you.<br><br>Visit our facebook Page : https://www.facebook.com/unitedpaws<br><br>\nSubmit an adoption application at  https://unitedpaws.wordpress.com/adoption-application/",

She was a scared 6 week old kitten who showed up on the porch of one of our rescuers. She is hilariously spunky and loves to play. Since coming in to foster care she has bonded with another cat in her home. Fawn is 2 yrs old and was rescued from a feral mom as a kitten. Though she lives with other cats she has never had a close companion. This may be because of her quiet, gentle nature. Amazingly, she and Liberty Belle have become like kitten sisters. They wrestle and play constantly and sleep together. Because of this close relationship their foster mom would like to find them a home together. An adult home would be best and both will need to be indoor only. A sweeter pair you will not find.

He is very shy at first and is likely to find a safe place to hide, but will come out for treats and sometimes to play. He's more social than his sister, and is quicker to let you approach him, he tries to communicate with you by meowing, and once you gain his trust he'll slowly start coming to you for attention.We are offering reduced pricing to the right home for Squeak.

We were all surrendered for adoption by the person who had cared for us and our mother for the last three months. She was moving and couldn't care for all of us where she was going to be living in the future. She described me as active, affectionate, friendly to everyone, bold, daring and fearless. I enjoyed sleeping with my mom and siblings, chasing after toys, climbing, jumping, wrestling and just hanging out. I'm hoping to find a nice home with a safe back yard in a quiet neighborhood with owners who will love me forever. I'd be a great addition to anyone's pet family so what are you waiting for?

Smokey and I are here together at Greenhill, hoping that our adoption into new homes will happen very soon. We were found as tiny stray kittens in the Cottage Grove area, and were taken to the shelter there and then transferred to Greenhill. Because we were so young we were placed in a foster home for about two months of growing-up time. During my time there I had lots of fun chasing my brother, playing with toys, napping in a kitten bed and gazing out the window. I also learned all about using a scratching post and litter box and met lots of new people. My foster parent said I'm \"very cuddly when tired, but also very energetic and playful when awake.\" If you're thinking about adopting a new kitten then you better hurry out to Greenhill right away because I probably won't be here very long!

    "description": "Hello ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>Allow me to introduce myself. \nI am a Siamese one year old female. My name is Zuri. It means beautiful in Africa. Which you can see, fits me perfectly. My foster mother says I am the most beautiful feline she has ever seen! I am soft, super sweet and loving too. With a playful side. I have a long coat which sheds a bit so hair balls might become an issue when I groom myself, but so far it hasn't. \nI like to sit with my human and enjoy gentle loves and pets. Naps of course is my favorite activity most of the day. I am not too finicky about my food and I don't bite, scratch, or fight which means that any other animals or humans in the home have to be respectful of me other wise they might hurt me when I don't fight back. \nI absolutly love sitting in a window and watching the birds and squirrels. I love it so much that I chatter at them and want to run outside any chance I get and chase them! I am so fast and silent that my foster mom gets scared when she can't find me. A little kitty trick I play on her every once in awhile, haha. My foster mom won't let me outside because she says it is the rescues rules and I might get lost or hit by a car outside, or since I am so beautiful, someone might catnap me. She takes really good care of me to ensure I am safe and happy! I love wet food, but it is starting to make my trim waist line get a little plump, so I can only have it for a treat or a tiny bit each day. My foster mom leaves fresh dry food and water out for me all day. I love a nice warm and soft place to sleep. The back of the couch or her bed is great, but the dogs chase me. \nI like to play too! I have this one toy which my foster mom bought for me and it's so cool! It only cost $1 at the pet store and entertains me for quite awhile. Sometimes I lose it which can be frustrating for me but my foster mom always finds it and she said she will let me take it with me to my new family home!! \nWell that is alot of information about me so I really hope the right family finds me and adopts me forever! My foster mom sure does love me but she wants me to be in a permanent home of my own for the rest of my life which will be a long time since I am only one years old. I would love to meet my family soon. Wouldn't that be a superb Christmas gift for me?!\nThank you for reading my long bio. I just wanted you to know everything about me so you can make the best decission for your family and me!<br><br>Sincerely,\nZuri the beautiful\n\nPlease contact us for more details 541-782-THOR (8467) or fill out our application on our website under adoption application at www.theheartofrescue.com.",

Kittens have always been social, playful, not the least bit wild.  They have adapted well to the foster home and other kittens.  They especially enjoy canned food (Fancy Feast Kitten/Turkey), Robert is usually first to the food bowl, with Reginald close behind.  Robert enjoys people most.  Randall seems the most curious â fearless!  Rhonda is smallest â dainty little sister.  Richard is more shy, but still doesnât mind being picked up and held.  LOVE the laser toy.  Nice purr motors.  All have had some exposure to adult cats in the foster home.",

    "description": "Found along the side of Hwy 220, my littermates scattered when the car stopped to try and gather us.  I lagged behind a big, the smaller of them, so I was captured, and not very happy about it either.  No one else was found.  I was then taken to the shelter, but was sooooo tiny, at about 2 weeks of age.  I hissed and spat big time, so they gave me space.  Still being bottle fed, but not thriving very well, I was put in the pen with the four other kittens that had also just arrived.  One of the 3 week old kittens, Fionna, immediately began cleaning my face and ears and acting all motherly to me.  That comforted me a lot.  I camped out with them, and when I finally decided I could be a kitty, they noticed a strangeness to my gait.  Off to the vet I went, and the x-rays revealed that I have a fractured femur that was already beginning to calcify around the break.  At this point, I could have it re-broken and pinned, or let it heal as is, as us kitties are great healers.  We all opted on the latter.  So, I rest more that the others, am given extra formula for more calcium consumption, but may always walk crickled.  Have learned to purr and enjoy me tummy rubs.  I need you, a very special person.",

    "description": "Hi, my name is Eddie Money because I have \"No Control\" over my \"Shakin.\" I was born with cerebellar hypoplasia, but the good news is that it doesn't hurt, does not get progressively worse, nor does it have other health related problems. I can lead a normal full life with this condition! I just don't do well on stairs as I might fall. So if you have \"The Love in Your Eyes\" for me please \"Save a Little Room in Your Heart for Me\" and give me a forever home. I might even have \"Two Tickets to Paradise\" for you. I was born around the first part of July.",

I am pretty mellow and laid back (Well.. as far as a kitten goes..). I love cats wands with feathers the best! <br><br>I am deaf! Which is really common for beautiful white gals with blue eyes just like me. This doesn't affect me much except that sometimes I get startled easily. Just don't sneak up on me!<br><br>\nMy whole litter was tested for FiV and some of us came back positive. This does not mean we actually have it - apparently in kittens we can test positive and actually be negative! We will be retested when we are 6 months old (AND BAPS will pay for it.). \nEven if I do have it, it's not a huge deal! FiV cats live normal lives both in quality and duration.

I still get timid with fast movements or strangers so that's why I'm thinking a home with older kids and no dogs, or a dog who will ignore me would be best for me. My sister Johnnie is helping me overcome obstacles but I still rely on her to guide me and help me to see that there is nothing to be afraid of. So we really need to stay together. I know with time, and a lot of love I will come out of my shell and be the happy go lucky lap cat.\n\nHowâs my Health?\nI will be fixed and vetted before adoption.\n\nTo adopt this animal or find out more about the adoption process/fees please go to our websitewww.zoesanimalrescue.org.",

    "description": "Are you an Introvert? Because I am and I need someone who understands me. Oh, I'm not shy! Once I get to know you, I am the most playful, mischievous and loving kitten. But I'm not one to put on a big show for total strangers, so I can't compete with other kittens that rush over to you right away. If you'll just take some time and understand my world, you might find that I am perfect kitty match for you.I live with three grown cats in my foster home, and I like them just fine. I'm not great with loud noises, so I'm a little scared of big men and loud kids. I am lovey and like your attention, but I'm not needy, so I can handle it if you are away during the day as long as you give me love and play time when you get home. Gidget can be viewed in her foster home in the NW Portland/Cedar Mill area.

She has been around her foster's dogs and adult cats and gets along fine with them. Apple Cider is a good eater and has excellent litter box habits. She is spayed and has had all her kitten shots. Like most kittens, she will be happiest in a home with another kitten or active cat or dog to play with. It would be perfect if she could find a forever home with her sister. They have very similar personalities and are a beautiful pair. AC has been in foster care with teenagers, but would probably be fine with younger children.

The need is especially urgent as the weather heats up.\n\n\nCommitment is typically 2-8 weeks and requires a room where the mom and kittens can be separated from other household pets.  This might be a spare bedroom or even a good size bathroom.\n\n\nTo learn more, contact our Volunteer Program Assistant, Nancy Puro at 503-925-8803 or via email at nancyp@catadoptionteam.org.\n\n\nThank you for helping us save lives!\n\n\n*NOTE: The kittens pictured are all in their loving forever homes!  They were fostered by a great family until they were ready, and they are an example of the kittens you might foster.*",

She was a scared 6 week old kitten who showed up on the porch of one of our rescuers. She is hilariously spunky and loves to play. Since coming in to foster care she has bonded with another cat in her home. Fawn is 2 yrs old and was rescued from a feral mom as a kitten. Though she lives with other cats she has never had a close companion. This may be because of her quiet, gentle nature. Amazingly, she and Liberty Belle have become like kitten sisters. They wrestle and play constantly and sleep together. Because of this close relationship their foster mom would like to find them a home together. An adult home would be best and both will need to be indoor only. A sweeter pair you will not find.

    "description": "These two boys, their sister and their mother were summarily dumped on a street in Longview. A Rescued Paws friend caught them. They have all been \"fixed,\" had their shots and received microchips.<br><br>The boys' foster mom shared these remarks. \"Leonard is the longer haired one and is very adventurous and playful.  Sheldon is a bit playful but would rather cuddle, and it will take him a bit longer to warm up to someone new. But as long as his brother is by his side he is fine. I can't keep them out of water. They love the water and Leonard will actually try to jump in the tub with you. Sheldon is a talker who lives up to his name and is always complaining. They were named after characters in the show the Big Bang Theory. Sheldon has shorter hair and is lighter colored. <br><br>\nThey are good with other cats. They are good with little dogs 27 pounds or smaller which is what they are used to. We don't know how well they would do with a big dog..\n\n\nIf you would like to complete our Adoption Application, please do so!

The mom abandoned her when she was just old enough to be weaned and it was noticed then that she had infection in both her eyes. She was one of the lucky ones in that the infection had mostly healed on its own. Unfortunately, she still suffered damage to both her eyes. Because she has limited vision, she's very skittish, and because of this will need to go to a home with no small children.

She was found abandoned with her 3 sisters along the Willamette River, and was very underweight and had an eye injury. Her sister KALEA attempted to care for her by cleaning her and cuddling with her. Konani has blossomed into a super sweet, happy, and playful kitty with some medical care and with the loving attention of her sister. She is a lover; she will play and then she likes to get some human snuggling. Her cute little black nose checks out everything (you can tell her apart from Kalea who has an orange nose). Because Konani and Kalea are so bonded, we are asking that they be adopted together, and are offering them at a reduced price of $150 for the pair (instead of $110 per kitten), sponsored by the McIntosh family. She has been tested for feline leukemia and FIV (she is negative), spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, defleaed and dewormedâplus you get a free vet visit. Konani and Kalea are temporarily in foster care. For more info, call Beth at (541) 255-9296",

The important thing will be to create a feeling of safety for her by letting her settle in one room of your home with everything she needs: food, water, toys and a litter box. Interact with her during this time so she gets used to you being a part of her new life. Olivia is still learning not what is a toy and what is not- hands.<br><br>She would do best in a home with older, cat-savvy children who can respect her need for space. It will be important to create a safe place where kitten feels secure. We recommend providing a hidey-hole bed for your new feline. Feeding time and playtime will help create stronger bonds between you and your new family member. She will need toys and lots of time with you, but most of all she will need your patience and love to blossom to her full potential.<br><br>\nAll adoptions include: \nÂ· Spay/Neuter surgery \nÂ· FeLV tested \nÂ· FVRCPC vaccine and booster \nÂ· Microchip and free registration \nÂ· Free health check at a list of local veterinarians \nÂ· Free carrier and Cat Collar \n\nWe take in only stray and abandoned animals, so we may not have extensive knowledge of their behavior, but we'll do our best to make sure it is a good match.\n\nOur adoptions requirements are: \nÂ· You must be the registered home owner OR provide landlord approval \nÂ· All family members must visit your new kitty before finalizing the adoption. \nÂ· Any dogs in the home must have a current Rabies vaccine and license",

    "description": "Oliver is a sweet kitten who is shy to new people and situations. He will need a family dedicated to giving him the time and environment he needs to feel safe and comfortable to become a well-adjusted adult cat. He would do best in a home with adults only. It will be important to create a safe place where Oliver feels secure. We recommend providing a hidey-hole bed for your new feline. Feeding time and playtime will help create stronger bonds between you and your new family member. He will need toys and lots of time with you, but most of all she will need your patience and love to blossom to his full potential. If you feel you are ready to provide a lifetime of care and companionship to this little kitten, he will repay you with unconditional love. <br><br>All adoptions include: <br><br>Â· Spay/Neuter surgery \nÂ· FeLV tested \nÂ· FVRCPC vaccine and booster \nÂ· Microchip and free registration \nÂ· Free health check at a list of local veterinarians \nÂ· Free carrier and Cat Collar \n\nWe take in only stray and abandoned animals, so we may not have extensive knowledge of their behavior, but we'll do our best to make sure it is a good match.\n\nOur adoptions requirements are: \nÂ· You must be the registered home owner OR provide landlord approval \nÂ· All family members must visit your new kitty before finalizing the adoption. \nÂ· Any dogs in the home must have a current Rabies vaccine and license",

I'm active, playful and curious and I'm here at Greenhill with my three littermates. We're all hoping that our wait to find new homes won't be a long one because we're all very anxious to get on with our very young lives. We were all surrendered for adoption by the person who had cared for us and our mother for the last three months. She was moving and couldn't care for all of us where she was going to be living in the future. She described me as active, affectionate, friendly to everyone, bold, daring and fearless. I enjoyed sleeping with my mom and siblings, chasing after toys, climbing, jumping, wrestling and just hanging out. I'm hoping to find a nice home with a safe back yard in a quiet neighborhood with owners who will love me forever. I'd be a great addition to anyone's pet family so what are you waiting for? Come out today and let's meet each other! (DO)",

My favorite activities are chasing my brother Smokey and my favorite toys are little balls and wands with feathers. Smokey and I are here together at Greenhill, hoping that our adoption into new homes will happen very soon. We were found as tiny stray kittens in the Cottage Grove area, and were taken to the shelter there and then transferred to Greenhill. Because we were so young we were placed in a foster home for about two months of growing-up time. During my time there I had lots of fun chasing my brother, playing with toys, napping in a kitten bed and gazing out the window. I also learned all about using a scratching post and litter box and met lots of new people. My foster parent said I'm \"very cuddly when tired, but also very energetic and playful when awake.\" If you're thinking about adopting a new kitten then you better hurry out to Greenhill right away because I probably won't be here very long!

    "description": "Hello ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>Allow me to introduce myself. \nI am a Siamese one year old female. My name is Zuri. It means beautiful in Africa. Which you can see, fits me perfectly. My foster mother says I am the most beautiful feline she has ever seen! I am soft, super sweet and loving too. With a playful side. I have a long coat which sheds a bit so hair balls might become an issue when I groom myself, but so far it hasn't. \nI like to sit with my human and enjoy gentle loves and pets. Naps of course is my favorite activity most of the day. I am not too finicky about my food and I don't bite, scratch, or fight which means that any other animals or humans in the home have to be respectful of me other wise they might hurt me when I don't fight back. \nI absolutly love sitting in a window and watching the birds and squirrels. I love it so much that I chatter at them and want to run outside any chance I get and chase them! I am so fast and silent that my foster mom gets scared when she can't find me. A little kitty trick I play on her every once in awhile, haha. My foster mom won't let me outside because she says it is the rescues rules and I might get lost or hit by a car outside, or since I am so beautiful, someone might catnap me. She takes really good care of me to ensure I am safe and happy! I love wet food, but it is starting to make my trim waist line get a little plump, so I can only have it for a treat or a tiny bit each day. My foster mom leaves fresh dry food and water out for me all day. I love a nice warm and soft place to sleep. The back of the couch or her bed is great, but the dogs chase me. \nI like to play too! I have this one toy which my foster mom bought for me and it's so cool! It only cost $1 at the pet store and entertains me for quite awhile. Sometimes I lose it which can be frustrating for me but my foster mom always finds it and she said she will let me take it with me to my new family home!! \nWell that is alot of information about me so I really hope the right family finds me and adopts me forever! My foster mom sure does love me but she wants me to be in a permanent home of my own for the rest of my life which will be a long time since I am only one years old. I would love to meet my family soon. Wouldn't that be a superb Christmas gift for me?!\nThank you for reading my long bio. I just wanted you to know everything about me so you can make the best decission for your family and me!<br><br>Sincerely,\nZuri the beautiful\n\nPlease contact us for more details 541-782-THOR (8467) or fill out our application on our website under adoption application at www.theheartofrescue.com.",

Emmet will need to be inddors only, fed a high quality diet with canned and dry food, and NO de-clawing is allowed.

These little fur babies mamma was a drop off at a very nice persons home.  The owner took her in and loved her and cared for her and her kittens until they were old enough to be adopted.  Maggie is great with other cats, doesn't mind kids, and is totally comfortable with dogs. She is very calm, fairly laid back, and loves to be cuddled. But don't let her laid back personality fool you; she is super playful and loves all sorts of toys.  <br><br>\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.

He is very sassy and has a lot to say about his day and his life in a cat world. He loves to come to you to rub all over you and has a very loud purr. He is super playful, but will calm right down to cuddle with you when you want to. He was a bottle fed kitten that came from our local shelter. Now heâs old enough to find his loving fur-ever home. <br><br>\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours.

Cooper will be an awesome addition to a family that can give him the attention, exercise, training and affection he deserves.\n\nHealth: Cooper has been neutered and microchipped. He is current on his vaccines and tested negative for Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). He has been wormed and flea treated.\n\nHistory: Cooper comes from an overcrowded shelter in California. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. All dogs and cats PUP pulls from California come with health certificates, as required by Washington state.\n\nNotes from Cooper's Foster Home: Cooper is a wonderfully affectionate, fun kitten. He loves to be held, and will climb into your lap to make sure you pet him. He's very playful and will chase string for hours. In his foster home, Cooper has become best friends with the 3 year old cat and plays games with her under the door. He would do well in a house with a playmate - be that human, feline, or canine!

Unless otherwise requested, any adoption applications we received will be kept on file for future adoption consideration.<br><br>* Female Domestic Long Hair/ Maine Coon<br><br>* Approximately 5 months/years old\n* Approximately 4 lbs.\n* Litterbox trained\n* Okay with other cats\n* Okay with dogs\n* Adoption fee: $100\n\nRaising a kitten requires a lot of work and is a commitment! Jorie will be an awesome addition to a family that can give her the attention, exercise, training and affection she deserves.\n\nHealth: Jorie has been spayed and microchipped. She is current on her vaccines and tested negative for Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). She has been wormed and flea treated.\n\nHistory: Jorie comes from another local rescue. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. \n\nNotes from Jorie's Foster Home:\n\nLittle Jorie is the sweetest and the most feminine little kitty I've met.She is fairly reserved as in a little shy if her surroundings become too busy; she prefers to observe from the sidelines, if at all.  She is not into racing and chasing....it's as though she regards it as \"unladylike\".   Jorie does love her cat tree; climbing high to watch the birds, napping or an occasional tango with a hanging toy.\n\nIn the evenings, when the fur kids are quietly hanging out, watching TV or sleeping, Jorie comes along and joins pups and kitties alike, in my lap so she can gather up her fair share of love!!!  She is VERY affectionate.  She will climb on you like a cat tree....back of the chair behind your head, on your head, your shoulders...all while purring quite loudly, to the tune of some dance routine only she can see or hear.\n\nDuring the day when she's not sleeping on the basket of laundry, I'm most apt to find her sleeping upstairs on my bed.  Jorie's favorite friend is my older cat, Tomas.  Tomas is my 15 lb. retired farm cat and mouser who is also not interested in the teenage play of \"catch me if you can\", racing up and down the stairs.  I often see him lazing about on the bed washing Jorie's face.\n\nJorie is one who would shine her brightest as an only kitten with an adult kitty friend or maybe a teenage friend that is also happier living the mellower life, much like herself.  I believe Jorie would love playing as long as her mate was not as rambunctious as her current housemates!  She would also feel very blessed if her new home included a nice, high kitty tree.  :) \n\n{ Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the cat's foster home.

From his wide eyed, expressive, huge, orange eyes to his lovely, silky, soft, beige, tiger stripe coat an white bib!!  He is adorable and oh, so affectionate!! \n\nPipin is very playful and tries very hard to keep up with the big boys with all the playing.  He loves talking to you, rubbing on you and climbing on you. He is well litter box trained and gets along well with the dogs as long as they are kitty friendly and not into chasing. \n\nPipin is a little shy when he first meets someone, dog or human; however, his curiosity soon wins out!! Pipin is especially friend when he knows you're otherwise engaged...and will quickly want up on your lap...then down...then up...and so on. \n\nPipin has not been around any children but he has been around my caged birds.  He quickly learned not to walk or sit on the cage tops.  Conures are small parrots that have painful nips!!  So he's pretty much content to just observe.  :-).

Please contact the Foster Care Hotline at 206-684-0685 to arrange a meeting. Thank you! My foster mom likes to refer to me as the \"Comeback Kid\". My original sweet nature was temporarily hidden by my fears from being raised outside without human contact. But with time and patient foster parents I have joyfully reclaimed my naturally curious, happy, and playful personality. I have been called \"drop-dead gorgeous\" with my medium length tortie coat and striking markings. Also, I am quite the aerialist when it comes to playtime with my favorite feather toy, then I like to settle into a warm lap for cuddles and brushing. I am very bonded with my sweet, handsome brother, Licorice. Like our names imply, we would like to stick together if at all possible. I also dream of a fairly quiet home so that I can continue to build confidence and learn to trust my adoptive family completely. I am a good eater and have perfect litterbox habits. Are you the one to whom I can devote myself forever? CARING FOR CATS: In addition to yearly vet visits, cats require proper nutrition, fresh water, and clean, well-located litter boxes (at least one litter box per cat). If litter box issues arise, call a vet ASAP to rule out anything medical; most issues are easily resolved with a few small adjustments. Cat claws can be carefully trimmed as needed, but we discourage declawing because it can cause serious health and behavioral issues. Familiarity with common household hazards can go a long way in keeping cats safe. Statistically, indoor cats live longer than outdoor cats and tend to have less medical expenses. Some cats would enjoy having safe access to the outdoors, either on a leash and harness, with supervision, or in an enclosed area - however, many cats can live happily and successfully as indoor only pets. To reduce the chance of boredom and depression, cats should have a stimulating environment. Cats enjoy cozy places to relax and look out windows, high perches for surveying, a sturdy scratching post (appropriate places to scratch are a must), boxes or beds to hide in so they feel safe, catnip, cat grass, food puzzles, and toys. Cats also need daily exercise with interactive playtime. Tiring them out before bed (with a snack to follow) can help ensure everyone gets a better nights sleep.  Newly adopted cats will need time to adjust to their surroundings. Patience and compassion will help ease the transition. With good care and lots of love, cats can live 15 or more years.

Please contact the Foster Care Hotline at 206-684-0685 to arrange a meeting. Thank you! Rob Roy is a sweet young, energetic boy who loves to run and play. If you throw a treasured toy across the room he will gladly chase after it and then entertain you with some one-cat soccer. He loves to climb and explore or dart across the tile floor and slide under the sofa to retrieve a lost toy. Have dust bunnies in hard to reach places? Rob Roy will gladly find them for you and pull them out into the open! Favorite toys include the laser, shadows, and a small soft ball filled with catnip. Though timid at first and hesitant to be pet, Rob Roy enjoys human companionship and especially likes to follow you around the house and observe all you do. He is particularly attuned to meal times , eager to remind you when it's time to be fed. Rob Roy is not a clingy cat but once he feels comfortable, will happily snuggle at your feet as you're waking up in the morning! Rob Roy adores other cats and would find himself quite lonely without a patient older brother or sister to play with and continue his studies in all things feline. He would do best in a somewhat quite home with both people and cats willing to play with him. Older kids, or patient younger children, should be OK. Rob Roy has been treated for a gastrointestinal condition in the past and needs a guardian who can commit to always feeding him a particular grain-free diet to keep him healthy. This food is easily found at local pet stores or vet offices [or possibly on line where it might be cheaper?]. In return for this minimal care, he will make a handsome, healthy, and entertaining companion.",

    "description": "DOB 6/22/15 Mocha (the black kitty) is very curious and social. Hi foster home writes: He still hides at first, but comes out shortly after. He almost scratched my doorknob off in my bathroom and was meowing so loud at night that I would bring him into my bedroom at night. I would wake up to him curled up on my bed and each day he got closer and now snuggles right beside me. He is extremely curious and loves to watch/follow my other cat and really loves chasing toys around (preferably balls that roll and jingle). His purr is one of the loudest I've heard and you don't have to be petting him to hear it. He starts to purr as soon as he is in the presence of people/kitties. He also loves food and comes running each time I feed him, and loves dried salmon treats. He should be adopted with his sister, Toffee.We are open for adoptions Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday from 12-7. <br><br>If the cat in in a foster home, we are happy to arrange an appointment.

    "description": "Micah and Kelby are cute, sweet, and fun.  These two sisters are almost identical, and they absolutely love attention.  They are always exploring, playing, cuddling, and practically purr just thinking someone might come into the room.  Their mother was seen jumping out of a trailer that was being moved from one junk yard to another.  At the new location, two tiny kittens were found hiding under the trash.  These girls were instantly happy with whatever life had given them despite the sad beginnings.  Now they are looking and waiting for a great home to appreciate all the love they have to give!  Micah and Kelby are not Cat Tales cats but are being posted as a courtesy for another rescuer. <br><br>If you would like to meet Micah and Kelby please email fortheloveofcush@gmail.com.\nUpdate from their foster mom, straight from the girls' mouths....<br><br>Hi! How are you doing?! We know it's not really the right forum in which to ask, but we're just such polite girls that we couldn't resist, and we absolutely love making new friends! You should also probably know that we'v  been told that we're the best kind of friends to have because we can make anyone smile (no matter what kind of day they've had) with our infectiously happy and enthusiastic personalities and affinities for snuggles.  We can liven up even the most boring tasks with our always interested presence and selfless offers of assistance, and we pretty much radiate sunshine with our gentle but loud purrs, prances with tails raised, and soft head bonks. So, if you're looking for two new best friends who were born with the ability to make every one of your days better just by being ourselves, our foster family is pretty sure the slogan \"who rescued who?\" was written with us in mind!  Please email fortheloveofcush@gmail.com to find out more about us!\n\nP.S. We're about 7-months-old, spayed, vaccinated, FIV/FeLV tested, microchipped, and litterbox trained!",

Oasis got a call from a nice couple who found a litter of kittens under a tarp that was covering the cushion on their deck swing! Oasis went over and gathered up the kittens and also found their mom, Angel, who is also available for adoption. Jimmie and his litter mates were about 5 weeks old and were all brought inside, where Angel raised them. Jimmie is one of 5 kittens and really loves his litter mates. Jimmie would do best if adopted into the same home with one of his litter mates to play with. Kittens do best if they have a buddy to play with. Jimmie gets along well with everyone, but will be shy of new surroundings at first. He requires a family that will give him lots of attention and time to adjust. When adopting a kitten, the human family needs to understand that kittens are active and get into mischief, plus they do require lots of time, attention and patience. It's also necessary to understand that kittens will need the time to adjust to the new situation. Jimmie is a cute boy, with glossy black fur, with a touch of white and big round eyes. Adopting an animal is a lifetime commitment, so please do not adopt until you can make that commitment. Jimmie is neutered, vaccinated, flea treated and wormed. If you are interested in adopting him, please fill out and submit our on-line application, which is on our website at www.oasisforanimals.org or let us know if you have any questions.

Oasis got a call from a kind couple, after they found the tiny babies inside the playhouse. We rescued mom and her kittens and brought them safely inside. Marnie and her siblings were raised by their mom in a wonderful foster home. Their mom also accepted another litter of orphaned kittens as her own and raised them too!  Marnie loves to play with his litter mates, as well as other kittens and playful young cats. She likes to cuddle and sleep with at least one other kitten and we often find them in a big pile! Marnie would do best if adopted into a home with one of her litter mates, or another kitten. Kittens do best if they have a buddy to play and snuggle with - especially when the adopter is away at work. Marnie is a young playful kitten, who may be a bit shy of new situations and as is typical of most kittens, should be given time to adjust to a new situation. If you adopt Marnie and hopefully a litter mate or another kitten, they will need time to adjust to the new situation. Then be prepared for lots of fun, affection and action! Marnie loves cat toys & canned food! If you adopt her, you will be very fortunate. It's necessary for adopters to understand that kittens will need some time to adjust and learn about their new family. Marnie is a cute black/brown kitten, with just a bit of white on her chest.

John and his litter mates were given the best of care and are now ready for loving homes. Oasis provided them with good food and the care the whole family needed. John is a sweet boy, who would do best if he was adopted into the same home with one of his litter mates, or a home where there is another kitten for him to play with. The family will need to give him the love and attention he needs. Kittens do best if they have a buddy to play and snuggle with - especially when the adopter is away at work. John is a young kitten, who is playful, and as is typical of most kittens, will need time to adjust to a new situation. He loves to eat - both canned and dry food! If you adopt him, you will be very fortunate. It's necessary for adopters to understand that kittens will need some time to adjust and learn about their new family. John is a handsome boy, with short brown tabby fur, and gold eyes. Adopting an animal is a lifetime commitment, so please do not adopt until you can make that commitment. John is neutered, vaccinated, flea treated and wormed. If you are interested in adopting him, please fill out and submit our on-line application, which is on our website at www.oasisforanimals.org or let us know if you have any questions. We are located on the south end of Whidbey Island, about 15 minutes from the ferry landing in Clinton. We normally take cats to various locations on the mainland on the weekends for adoption, so please just ask or check our Facebook page. Thank you for adopting homeless, rescued kitties!",

Her belly was swollen; possibly full of worms and her body was covered in fleas.  That may have stunted her growth because sheâs still a small kitty at the young age of 3+ months.  She can be a skittish and could use more human contact to improve her socialization skills.  She responds well to kissing around her face just like a momma cat would give her affection.

A kind hearted student heard him meowing and rescued him, bringing him to the shelter. He was just a little guy then, thought to be only about 2 months old. Now about five months old, Oliver is a rather shy kitten and is looking for a special owner who will give him lots of time and space. He will allow special people that he considers friends to hold and pet him and rewards them with a nice purr. He seems to like the other kittens and adult cats at the cat center so would probably enjoy having a feline friend. A good looking little fellow, if you look closely at Oliverâs coat, you will see tabby stripes. - See more at: http://www.waifanimals.org/cats/oliver/#sthash.HeOfIzfc.dpuf",

Mao and Oscar were recently returned because they began spraying in their home. After consultation with a vet, it was felt that the active young children in the home and a new neighbor cat outside were creating too much stress for these boys. Mao is a slightly shy, reserved boy who seeks comfort from his more outgoing brother, Oscar. The brothers are truly bonded and are looking for a quiet, safe forever home together. Like all Purrfect Pals cats, Mao Joker has been viral tested, altered, microchipped and vaccinated.",

Mama Ella raised her kittens in a wonderful foster home until they were old enough to find their own forever homes.

Bright and almost insatiably curious, he loves attention, loves to explore, and really loves to play, especially with the laser toy! He's equally happy to say hello to people, and to other cats too. When that's all done, and he's finally tuckered out, he'll find a comfortable spot to stretch out and settle in for a nap. Now that his mama and sisters have all found homes of their own, Socks is getting a little lonely.

Rory will thrive best in a home with a patient owner because of lack of socialization. Rory is a bit timid upon first meeting, but he will let you grab him and pick him up. He has never shown any sign of aggression, he is just not used to being loved. Rory is just a sweet boy looking for love. Are you that special someone?",

Please note: The picture above is a stock photo.<br><br>Thank you for your interest in foster kittens! \nKittens who are in our foster care program are generally kittens who arrived at the humane society as unweaned orphans , were still nursing, or were not old or big enough to be placed up for adoption. These kittens would not have survived in a stressful shelter environment. Our foster care program provides care and comfort for animals with special needs in private homes of our trained volunteer foster care providers. \nOnce the kittens are old enough (usually 6-8 weeks) and weigh enough to be spayed or neutered (2 lbs), they return to the shelter for adoption. Call the shelter at (360) 733-2080 to inquire about available kittens. \nPlease note that we do not place âholdsâ on animals until youâve met them in person, even if youâve filled out an application and expressed interest in a specific animal. This is because we want to ensure that each animal is a good fit for the interested party, and that the interested party is a good fit for the animal. We try to set each adoption up for success, for both the animals and for the people.  \nThe kittens would love to meet you! Do you feel the same? Please fill out an adoption application (here or at either shelter) and turn it in to Emily Wyss the foster care coordinator via email at foster@whatcomhumane.org, or fax it to 360.733.4746. Our adoption counselors will help you figure out if you're right for each other.<br><br>Questions about foster kittens in general or other foster animals?

    "description": "Stevie is a lovely male kitten who is blind. We are guessing his birthdate is in the first week of August 2015. He was born into a feral colony on a farm, and was one of a litter of five, all of his siblings being orange tabbies. Stevie is a long-haired cat, and although his coat started as solid black, it has been developing a very distinctive black smoke colour. Stevie has been neutered and vaccinated.<br><br>Stevie had his eyes removed when he was nearly three months old as a result of a combination of glaucoma and infection. Other than the eyes, he has been very healthy. His personality is amazing. He is both fun and funny, and outgoing. Although he had to be in screaming pain for most of his life, he never stopped purring and playing. After his eye surgery, he came out of the anaesthetic and immediately started to play with the vet techs. <br><br>\nStevie loves to explore on his own and does not need anyone to move him to a new space - he can find his way just fine. He jumps and plays just like a cat who can see. Until he knows the distance, he backs down off the couch or chair, but when he figures out the distance he will just jump. A paper bag is a great adventure for him (see video), and he loves to play with his ball as well. Stevieâs littermate, who is also up for adoption, is a good buddy to him, if anyone would be interested in the pair together.\n\nStevie will be able to lead an almost completely normal life, but he will need to be strictly indoor-only. He will need a fairly static environment - a home without clutter and that has furniture and things that are not moved around a lot. He will learn every inch of his new home and then will never bump into anything -- if nothing moves. He gets along well with the other kittens, cats, and dogs in his foster home. It would be nice if he could have an animal friend to enrich his life in his adoptive home, but we don't want his adoptive home to have very playful dogs or aggressive cats because of Stevie's obvious disadvantage. A suitable adoptive home will not have family members younger than teenagers. \n\nIt would be best if he could go to someone with experience with blind cats, but a motivated person could certainly learn how to care for him. His adoption will be subject to a $225 fee and a home visit. Please contact us at mbruce8@shaw.ca if you are interested in Stevie and tell us about yourself and the life you envision for him. \n\nYou can view a video of Stevie at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx3fubTdr2Q",

    "description": "*** Please note that the kittens in the photos are from previous years.  Please contact us to find out if we currently have any kittens available.  ***<br><br>When we have kittens, our kittens don't live at the shelter. They're in foster homes and will be ready for adoption once they're weaned.  If you are interested, please complete the standard pre-adopt form on our web site. We can arrange for you to meet the babies so you can pick out your new family member.<br><br>\nThe kittens will need to go to homes where they will have a cat friend to keep them company, to play with them and snooze with them while you're busy. It doesn't necessarily have to be another kitten (though that's ideal), as long as they will have a young feline friend. These are social critters who rely on games with feline pals to learn life skills. Those who grow up without feline company tend to lose the ability to relate to other cats and have a harder time adjusting to the presence of other cats later in life. They can also become overly dependent on you. We also ask that our kittens go to indoor homes for safety from traffic, predators, disease, poisons, and other dangers in the outside world.\n\nHaving a kitten is like having a toddler in the house. They'll get into everything and they can keep you up at night by scampering around or pouncing your moving toes under the blankets. You'll need patience and you'll need to kitten-proof your house. Cover the soil of your potted plants, hide delicate ornaments and jewelry, tie back your sheer drapes, keep the toilet lid down and check the washer and dryer before you turn them on. After a year or so, your rambunctious little monster will settle down and become a dignified, inscrutable feline who is content to spend long periods meditating and napping. He or she will need you for the next 15 to 20 years of a cat's life span. So consider where you might be 15 or 20 years from now and be sure your cat can still be with you. If you're ready to take on a furry baby, please contact us!",

Baby Beans doesnât careâ¦ he frolics and plays like any other kitten. However, his case is extreme and he is also bowel and bladder incontinent.<br><br>\nThis incontinence caused his people to bring him to be euthanized. The vet just could not euthanize a roly, poly, playful, purring baby (we are so very fortunate to work with so many kind, compassionate vets) so they asked us if we could help. Incontinent animals are a challenge from a practical perspective, and Beans will also need to be closely monitored as he will be susceptible to infections.\n\nWe donât know how long he will be with us, but he is here now. He is joyful and he is greatly loved.",

Although heâs only about eight months old you can usually find him lounging around.  He likes to chill on just about any surface.  This is not to say that this boy doesnât like to play.  Of course he does, heâs really just a kitten. <br><br>Mr. Green has an old eye injury but it does not seem to affect him at all.  The white on the eye is the scar from the injury.  Mr. Green came to us from another shelter and we donât have too much information on his past.  However we have been informed that he loves other felines and canines.  We figure Mr. Green will do best in a home where he has feline and/or canine companions to play with. <br><br>\nMr. Green is a sweet kid who like attention and snuggles.  He will be a perfect addition to any family.  Not much seems to phase Mr. Green and he adjusted to the shelter very quickly. \n\nWe are sure who ever adopts Mr. Green will be one lucky family :D",

He's a bit shy to start, however, once he comes out of his shell he loves running up against your legs and chatting with you!

They never scratch or bite. They may hiss when they first get to their new home, but I really doubt it. They have never had an accident once, they use their litter box neatly and diligently, they don't get into anything they shouldn't, and they don't scratch the furniture. Even if I accidentally leave their treats out (which they love), they will be exactly where I left them, untouched.<br><br>\nThese gorgeous girls LOVE to PLAY, and I have found it is the best way to engage and bond with them. They play on their own a bit too but especially like when I play with them. It's very sweet to see how aware these two are of each other and how they each let the other have their turn to play back and forth. It is very important that these two girls go to a home where someone will play with them every day. \n\nShay is starting to come around more, and clearly likes to be 'near the action' as long as it doesn't get to close. When she is in the mood-you'll be able to tell when she is very relaxed- she will let you scratch her under her chin and behind the ears and she obviously enjoys it, but can only handle so much. Once in a while she also lets you hold her. She will definitively get better and better as she gets more trusting, and I am sure she is going to be a love bug one day.\n\nTaya and Shay are bonded and must be adopted together.",

    "description": "Kiri is a 12 week old dilute tortoiseshell female kitten. She has big eyes that gaze right into yours, asking if you will be he friend. Kiri is a little fearful of new people and new situations, but once she is comfortable she is a typical happy kitten. She likes to be petted but is not overfond of being held, except for short periods when SHE wants to cuddle. That is the famous \"tortietude\" personality showing up. Kiri wants what she wants when she wants it, and not when YOU want it. Kiri has a brother, Trevor. They do not have to be adopted together, but if they were it would be nice. They get along well and would keep each other company in a home where people are gone to work or school most of the day. If you would like to meet Kiri, contact shannon@sierrapacificfurbabies.com or 707-441-9502. An application, home check and adoption fee of $75 are required.

    "description": "Trevor is handsome little 12 week old red swirl tabby kitten, who is alternately a bold adventurer and a shy scared baby who might hiss if he sees something big and scary - like a coat in a closet, or a vacuum! Initially cautious at first meeting new people, when he warms up and trusts you, he loves to be snuggled under your chin - as seen in a photo with his foster dad. He is also very playful and romps with his sister Kiri. While the two siblings do not have to be adopted together, they are good company for each other and keep themselves amused together. They would be happier if they were together. They would be excellent companions in a family where people are gone most of the day to school or work.

J.J. has already been neutered, and received two of his three kitten shots. The next shot will be due after November 17th. He has tested negative for FeLV and FIV and will be <br><br>microchipped upon adoption.<br><br>If you would like to meet this adorable little dynamo, please contact Shannon@sierrapacificfurbabies.com or 707-441-9502. He is being cared for in a foster home setting. A video of this little scamp is available on adoptapet.com and petfinder.com. If no one has responded to your phone message in 24 hours, please email. Adoption fee of $75, \napplication and home check required. Indoors-only home for this little guy. Discounts to seniors, military/veterans, and on disability.\n\nJ.J. loves other cats but does not yet realize they are bigger than he is and can hurt him. He tries to play with them with gusto! He has not been exposed to dogs. This little guy is completely and innocently captivating. Are you his furever home?",

There are currently 11 of us kittens available for adoption and three times that many of adult cats. If you are looking for a feline friend and companion, than look no further. Be it young or mature, there is someone for every person here at the Kelowna SPCA. I'm so looking forward to my own home! Please ask the Shelter Staff to meet with me.Thanks for your time.

I look like a kitten and a little old man all in one with my gray hairs all over the place & unruly ear hair. My eyes are as big as saucers and my face is very round & almost flat- almost like a Persian cat's face. I am a totally sweetheart but I am definitely on the shy, sensitive side. I would love to be in a quiet household where someone can just let me lay on their lap for hours & watch TV while scratching my head & twirling my ear tufts. I love other cats and nice doggies too & would do very well if I was adopted with a feline friend. I'm buddies with my sister SMOKE . You MUST come see me in person- all of my rescue moms said I have one of the cutest faces EVER!",

    "description": "This is a CP - Courtesy Post and not Fluff Buddies kitties.  If you'd like more information on Samurai and/or Noelia, please email their foster parent Sue Tabor at susantabor@sbcglobal.net or call/text (916) 213-7536.<br><br>Noelia is a sweet little orange and white domestic medium hair kitten who was born approximately 8/25/14.    She appeared in a feral colony when she was quite tiny, and was on her own for a short while before she was noticed by the caregivers. She has always been tame, but is shy.  Noelia still needs to be reassured that she is safe and loved. She does like to be held, petted, and scratched around her ears.  She also plays lively games with her other kitten fosters.  Noelia's great love, though, is her big buddy Samurai. Samurai has become her big brother and protector, in a world she is still learning is safe and predictable.  It would be ideal for both Noelia and Samurai if they could be adopted by the same family.<br><br>\nNoelia tested negative for leukemia, is current on her vaccinations, is microchipped, flea treated, and wormed. \n\nSamurai is a beautiful white domestic short hair male with yellow-green eyes, born approximately 8/27/12.  He is an extremely friendly and affectionate cat.  In his post as patriarch of the foster kittens, he has shown patience and dedication as he monitors and plays with those younger than himself.  He has taken a special fancy to Noelia, a little orange kitten in his charge.  This is fortunate for Noelia, because she is shy, and gets the love and reassurance she needs from her big buddy Samurai.  \n\nSamurai knows he has a gift for being in charge.  He makes other adult cats aware of his status in a more or less polite way.  For this reason, Samurai would probably do best in a home with one other cat who  \"sees reason\" (is not dominant).  His ideal home would be one where he and Noelia were the only kitties.\n\nSamurai is tested negative for leukemia and FIV and microchipped.  He is current on his vaccinations, flea treated, and neutered.",

    "description": "Bonded pair - must be adopted together.<br><br>Hi, our names are Sergeant Anthony (Sarge) & Griffin! We are brothers, born approximately 1/25/15, who were rescued from Front Street Shelter about 4 weeks ago (3/23/15). When our foster family picked us up at the shelter, we were beyond frightened. We were literally shaking in our boots, cowering into the corner of our carrier & hissing at anyone who was even thinking of touching us :( <br><br>\nAfter about one week we were a little more trusting & could be held for a few minutes at a time. Currently, we can be held while watching TV for about an hour. Our foster family feels that if we were in our own home with free roaming we would warm up quite nicely to our new family & environment. We are still a little shy, & we do sometimes hiss when approached. We feel we need to show that we are the boss! However, we NEVER EVER attack our foster humans! Even if we hiss, we can be picked up! So please don*t shy away!  Hold us close to your chest & speak calmly & reassuringly to us & we will be okay! \n\nWe have shown interest in our foster families kitties, but they weren*t very welcoming to us. At this time our foster family is advising that we be the only kitties in the home & that we be adopted together. If we are separated, we sit at the door & cry desperately until we are together again. We have not been around any dogs so we don*t know if we would be good companions with them or not!\n\nWe have purred many times when being held while our foster family watches TV or plays video games! They had a rule: No one was allowed to play video games or lounge around watching TV unless they were holding one of us *Shy Guys*!  We love toy mice & we love toys that have a ball inside for us to bat around & around! We would be thrilled if you would leave Nerf Bullets unattended for us to shred to pieces, but our Foster Family highly suggests that all Nerf Bullets be kept out of our reach!!  \n\nBoth of us will let you pet us while we eat our soft Fancy Feast kitten food & we are currently on Science Diet dry kitten food for our daily meals!\n\nPlease complete our adoption questionnaire at http://www.fluffbuddies.org/infoquestions.html\nAdoption events are held at the Fair Oaks Petco (Madison & Hazel) on Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 4pm.",

I know to sit at my bowl when I hear the word \"food\" and \"ghaza\". I know to run to the closet when I hear \"Baazi\" (play time in Farsi), because that's where human hides the kitty wand. And I know to line up on the stairs with my other kitty friends when I hear \"1,2,3\" because that's the time to play fetch. I purr when you pet me and meow when I want more food....Long story short, I'm the PUUUURFECT kitty! I will be yours ONLY IF you promise that you will feed me, love me and play with me AND decide that you will keep me forever...and I mean until the very last day of my life.  <br><br>Cheers, <br><br> Stella aka Paria (Angel Face)",

We are still looking for her mom and siblings so we can rescue the whole family, but so far, no luck!<br><br> Simba came to us flea infested and with caked dirt on her face and nose. We cleaned her up and placed her in foster care. She is healthy now and will soon be vaccinated, neutered, tested for FeLV/FIV, microchipped, etc. <br><br>\n Simba has a VERY playful and feisty personality. She is not loud. She carries around toys in her mouth. She loves to chase her wand toy. She allows us to pet her and carry her around, but she prefers to explore her surroundings over sitting still on laps and purring. Simba has no problems with other cats and dogs, though she prefers cats over dogs. She is a survivor and a lover girl indeed!\n\n To ADOPT, please e-mail us at info@TFPF.org!",

    "description": "Scruffy (darker one) is always thinking. He's looking around, planning things out and protective of his \"sister\". He's very playful and loves to attack long strings and carry sparkly balls around in his mouth. He's got a sweet and unique overbite. Very cute!! He let's his sister sit on his head, what a goofball.<br><br><br><br>Pretty Baby (lighter one) seems shy at first, but she is very curious and explores and plays like the rest. She loves a soft head pet and likes to meow softly and in a melodic way to communicate. She's beautiful.\n\nPlease let us know if you are interested by emailing us at madisonbott@hotmail.com.\n\nThey are beautiful. We are guessing they are between 2-3 months old. One has more scruffy hair so we call \"him\" Scruffy. The other we think is a girl and we call her Pretty Baby. They are very scared at the moment as they haven't been in a home before and handled this much. They have been eating, drinking, playing and using the litter box we set up for them. We are very hopeful for their future as they have made a lot of social progress in less than 24 hours. They allow us to pet their sweet little heads and back. They do not like it when we grab them to crate them, but it makes sense that that is pretty scary for them right now. They startle easily but with a couple days of support they will acclimate just fine. We need to find them homes right away. We have two older cats who are indoor only and they are stressing about these little newcomers. We really do not want to take them to a shelter.",

    "description": "HelloâWe are the Purrr-fect Family. Weâre healthy, three month old kittens. My mum was friendly, not only with people but with some of the male toms she met in the neighborhood. There are six of us and my mum and sisters and brothers were taken in by a nice family. There are 4 males and 2 females (blk and white). Weâre all darling! We have lots of energy, love to jump in and out of baskets, run and chase, and play with little toys. But best of all, we like to snuggle and be petted. Then we purr like crazy. We all use the litter box and we like both canned food and dry. Weâre easy to take care of and would love to live with you. Weâve all been spayed or neutered and had our first shot.

If she's not busy playing, she's snuggling up with her foster folks and taking a nap. Sweet, silly, and loving, Ainsley would probably do best with another kitten to play with, as well as a nice human lap to cuddle in. Ainsley was born in the wrong place--in the backyard of someone who hates cats! The property owner wanted them gone right now and drove her mom away. Luckily the property owner let us remove the kittens before they came to harm, so Ainsley and her kitten buddies, Grier and Ramsey, went to an experienced bottle feeder who took great care of them. Now she is a bright-eyed, friendly, loving and playful kitten ready for a home of her own. If you would like to meet Ainsley, please go to our Karma Rescue APPLICATION page.

His foster says, 'He is really one cool dude.' Ramsey came from a very bad situation but he's a sweet, friendly, loving kitten looking for a great home.

She is healthy, litter-trained, and ready for a very special forever home that will give her the attention she craves. Carli looks so unique! She has black and white tuxedo markings, but also some grey tabby stripes mixed in for good measure. We can't take our eyes off her--she's utterly original, and she has the personality to match! Carli is outgoing, with a feisty personality that makes her ready to romp and play at the drop of a hat. But she is also dedicated to cuddling with her humans, sleeping with her foster folks every single night--tucked into the side of one of them--and purring happily.

The South LA shelter was getting lots of moms + babies, and we stepped in to take these. Albert's sister was adopted and now he is waiting for a home of his own. Albert is about six months old (10/1/15) and ready to bring joy to some special family's life. Albert is so unique looking! He is mostly black, but has grey tufts at his ears, his chest, and legs. And he has the face of an EWOK! So. Darn. Cute. Albert also happens to be totally sweet! He loves to cuddle between his foster parents at night, and when he's sleepy he likes a nice tummy rub. We call him our 'chill kitty' because he's up for anything and nothing fazes him! Of course Albert can play hard too! He likes his fuzzy mice toys and his foil balls and he loves to stealth attack his foster sister (Carli, also for adoption) for some KITTY WRESTLING! He's also a big fan of feeding time and will let you know when it's time for dinner! Albert is a silly kitten, constantly making us laugh, so we know he'll bring laughter wherever he goes. Albert is great with other felines (and with humans) and because he is so young, he must go to a home with another kitty to continue his socialization and to keep him company. Or, maybe you would like to adopt Albert and his mom Addison together?? Consider Albert as the next member of your family!

    "description": "Spice was found in a bag inside a dumpster in an alley behind his foster momâs work, along with three other kitties. She gently gathered them up into her arms to save them, and then called us for help.<br><br> \nSpice loves people and he will follow you everywhere. He plays fetch and loves to play tag. He is very rambunctious and plays continuously until he suddenly drops and falls sleep. He is a super snuggler. At night he will curl up under your chin, and will wake you up by giving your face a nice grooming. He has a super enthusiastic purr when he greets you at the door. He loves to be carried and combed.\n \nSpice is a true Miracle Kitty! When Spice was a baby he started having problems swallowing, and his foster mom rushed him to the vet. He was diagnosed with a mega-esophagus which means that the tube that goes from his mouth to his stomach grew too fast when he was a baby. Recent x-rays show that it has stopped growing which should provide him relief as he gets bigger. The vet confirmed that they do not think the esophagus has continued to expand, and with his growth, that is excellent news! He eats standing up so that gravity can help his food go down. He has a custom made Lego table made for him so that as he grows more Legos can be added and so it grows with him. He also requires oral medication twice a day that helps pass the food into his stomach. He will need special care for the remainder of his precious life. He needs to be on a fish-free diet with water added to his food. Despite these challenges, Spice is an easy kitty to take care of. His foster mom says that he is doing great and he is very rambunctious!\n \nSpice would do best in a home where there is someone around with him. He cries when he is left alone. He would prefer a home without no other cat or dog so that he does not have access to their food as he will try to eat it and he could aspirate (get food in his lungs), catch pneumonia and suffer.\n \nSpice is about 14 weeks old. He has been vaccinated and will be fixed and micro-chipped. He is looking a very special forever home.  Please open up your heart and your home for this special little guy!\n \nIf you want to talk to his foster mom about adopting Spice, would like to meet him, or have questions, please call Cindy at (310) 927-1999.",

His foster mom refers to them collectively, as the Berry brothers!  Huckle, and Logan, are sweet and active, and true boyâs boys. They entertain their foster mom with their antics!  Playing is seriously job one for these brothers!  Unless it is nap and cuddle time. Even then, it is more fun to lie on their foster momâs feet to napâ¦in case a toe moves to pounce!  Feather sticks, balls, fake mice, paperâ¦they are up for any toy you provide. They are truly grateful to be free of the shelter cage and able to run and play as is evident in their happy-go-lucky attitudes. Huckle will bring a delightful joy to your life with his spirited personality.  Heâd really love to go to his forever home with his twin brother Logan, so why not double your fun and take home both!?!",

She went from a hissy crazy feral, to a sweet affectionate love bug.  She and her sister have been through the ringer and back, though. They both contracted panleukopenia, and almost died. They made it through, and they are now immune.  She is healthy, sassy and she's a talker! This girl has so much personality!  She is about 15 weeks old and current on vaccines, tested negative for feline leukemia and FIV.   Uses the litter box like a champ, loves food, and has a toy monkey that she doesn't ever part with.

She is equally phenomenal at spooning, and is happy to be either big spoon or little spoon, then she will race off and leap on cats 3 to 4 times her size, playing with relentless enthusiasm until she is literally panting in joy! Her kitten purr melts the hearts the iciest people on the planet, and she loves kisses all over her head and face and will happily return them!! This little girl is truly a rare gem, and anyone lucky enough to adopt her will be wondering how they survived before she joined their lives.  She is shockingly confident and outgoing, especially for such a little youngster.  Did we mention that anytime she hears a tissue being wadded up she comes running, hoping for a game of fetch?  Or that bed-making is the most exciting sport imaginable??  She loves her foster brothers Charlie and Bravo, if you are interested in adopting more than one cat, and if you want to fill your life with more joy than you thought was humanly possible!!!",

I didn't know what to think of all the strange humans who kept visiting me. But they keep petting me and feeding me and playing with toys with me and you know what?? I LIKE being petted and fed and playing with toys! Sometimes people put me on their laps for a snuggle and once I get comfy I could stay there for ever. Soft pets and soft words from a gentle person are the very best. I'd like to go to a home that isn't too busy, where the nice humans have lots of love to give me.",

The city shelter called PZF to see if we could take Lolly and her two siblings when they were turned in at 4 weeks of age.  They were too tiny to be adopted, let alone vaccinated, and staying in the shelter would expose them to respiratory disease.  They all went to live with one of our wonderful foster parents and so grew to be healthy and also very human-oriented and loving.<br><br>She is not shy, but also not an alpha cat. She loves to play with all the other kittens and cats in our open cattery area and is very affectionate and loving with people. She will be a wonderful companion to anyone who is looking for a gentle soul who will give back more love then you could imagine.<br><br>\nAnd she is cute as a button too!",

    "description": "Sweet TIKI<br><br>Kitten - 5 months old<br><br>Tiki is one ADORABLE kitten! She is only a few months old and still growing. Tiki was rescued from the shelter at a mere 4 weeks old when she was abandoned after having been attacked by a dog. Her front paw was crushed in the process. We have since taken her for orthopedic visits and at this point Tiki does not need any corrective surgery! She uses her leg just fine, her paw is just a little different looking. But that doesn't stop her from doing ANYTHING regularly mobile cats do. You wouldn't even know she had been through that. Tiki is very playful and needs another cat or dog to play and cuddle with. She is also extremely smart. Because of her minor disability, she will have to be an indoor only cat. Please email us if interested in meeting her! adopt@armeteam.org",

    "description": "DOB: 8/10/15 -  Hi! My name is Bear! I got my name from being the cuddly teddy bear that I am. There's nothing I love more than spending time with you. I'm an easy going kind of guy, but I also love to play. I get these energy bursts and run all around and do funny leaps in the air with my toys, then when I'm done I like to sprawl out on the ground and lie flat with my back legs sticking straight out in back like a little frog. I just love my cuddle time, and will purr loudly when you pet me. When I would like you to cuddle me, I do a very small, short, broken up, meow to get your attention. My foster parents say I sound like a little lamb because of my unique meow. I'm told I make a tiny snore noise when I'm sleeping or getting loving, and when I get an idea either to do something fun or to come get cuddles, I make a small \"ooh, ooh\" sound that my foster family says sounds like a baby monkey! I guess I'm a mixture of all sorts of animals! I'm cuddly like a bear, I lay like a frog, I meow like a lamb, and I make happy noises like a baby monkey! I have another talent too! I turn into liquid kitty! I love my time with you so much, that I just melt in your arms. I stare into your eyes and purr while you rub my face and cuddle me. I get so relaxed when you pet me, that I've been known to roll right off your lap, chest, bed, or desk and fall on the floor if you don't catch me! Thankfully, I always land on my feet! I guess you could say I literally \"fall for you\". I love to nap on you while you watch a movie, and make a great lounge buddy. My foster family describe me as a sweet puddle of love, and tell me there's someone special out there waiting with open arms that I can melt right into. Is that special someone you? <br><br>Fully vetted including double FVRCP vaccinations, tested for FeLV/FIV (Aids and Leukemia), flea treatment and spayed or neutered.

    "description": "This is Magic, an adorable 1/2 Siamese black kitten, with a sibling named Ashton.  Magic came with five siblings, at a very young age, along with their beautiful chocolate point mother, who was mostly feral.  The kittens were weaned and then fostered in a home of their own to be fully socialized and reach the age where they could go out on their own.<br><br>  The foster did a terrific job, and these kittens are beautiful, healthy, muscular, outgoing, and fun!  Magic does her best to convince potential adopters that she should be the one to get adopted. She will follow her humans around, participate in all of their activities, and then crash in their lap to generate energy for when she wakes up.\n  Magic will need another cat buddy, and cannot be an only child.  An adoption donation of $95.00 applies to her adoption, but if you want to adopt two kittens, a \"special\" can be offered.<br><br>NOTE:  Spunky's is a charitable organization and 100% of all donations and\nadoption fees go back into the saving and caring for these animals.\n        Our animals come from a variety of situations, and some come in off the street, in poor health, or very sick.  Others might have emotional issues or permanent physical issues caused by abuse.  They get the necessary veterinary care and lots of loving to make them ready to go to their \"forever\" home. \n     Please understand that some of our cats may still be in their \"before\" stage, whether its convalescing from illness or injury, learning to trust, or something as simple as beginning to thrive on regular meals and good nutrition.\n     We do not participate in any breeding or sales.  All cats are or will be altered prior to adoption.\n     Our adoption agreement allows for the return of any adopted animal at any time for any reason, and requires an animal to be returned if the adopter's circumstances should change and the animal can no longer be kept.",

Claudia is such a little observer, soaking up absolutely everything around her and when her stare falls on you, your heart will burst into a smile. She is such a beautiful little sweetheart, in and out, with her adorable âblack saddleâ markings, extremely gentle nature and unique owl-neck gazing (literally, like she can spin her head to gaze at something). This gorgeous little girl is the daintier, more demure and delicate half of the family â she is very bonded with her brother Telly, who is also up for adoption. Her brother usually âwinsâ their wrestling matches, but she definitely gets a few good attacks in! They are truly an amazing little pair to watch and it is in both their best interests to stay together in their forever home. She can't say no to anything that dangles and is also a world-class climber so cat trees or condos really are a must-have for her. Claudia is not very vocal, being more of a looker than a talker, but will let out her little squeak to let her brother know exactly when he has played a little too roughly with her...or when she's ready for some more treats. She has a very healthy appetite, but is a little on the smaller side due to being bottle-fed since she was two days old. As all Kitten Rescue kitties are, she has been spayed, dewormed, vaccinated and microchipped, so she is READY TO FIND HER FOREVER GUARDIAN!

He is a consummate explorer and adventurer. âPlay âtil I dropâ is most assuredly his motto...running and wrestling until he's panting. He and his sister, Claudia, are very bonded so it's in both their best interests to continue their adventure together, in their forever home...with you? He is a cuddling maniac. Unless of course, he is in the midst of a life or death chase with a little piece of crumpled up paperâ¦yes, he is that easily pleased with a simple, small ball of paper and will carry it around until it basically falls apart...at what point you just have to crumple up another post-it note. He does love climbing as well & is a bit of an escape artist. He is such a playful little character! He has been pretty specific when it comes to food, but Iâve discovered what he canât resist, so donât worry. Being bottle-fed since he was two days old, he started out on the smaller side, but has now come into his own with his puffy hair and enormous tail.

He loves to be petted and held and purrs when you pet him. Casanova often rolls on his back and makes biscuits in the air. He loves tummy rubs. This sweet boy gets along with everyone. Heâll plays with all the other kittens and also loves his toys.

    "description": "DOB: 4/1/15 Unagi was the first of his litter to be trapped and fixed, which is why he has an eartip. He came to us underweight and with a bad cold, from living in an industrial use lot in South Gate. Once we realized how tiny and friendly he was, we knew he had to be fostered. Unagi is spunky, loving and likes to feel that he is in charge. He is an affectionate cat and will snuggle in bed and on the couch. Gets along wonderfully with older cats who are amenable to kittens. Do not recommend as a solo cat. His whole litter (nicknamed the Sushi Kittens) are bonded and adopting a pair of them would make for excellent lifetime companionship for these guys. Unagi rolls over for belly rubs, just like all his siblings. His chirping meow and high flying leaps during feather toy playtime will steal your heart. Playful, active but also gentle and VERY sweet. Walks with the cutest little bow legged strut! We adore him. Siblings names are: Nori, Tako, Tamago, Miso, Toro.

    "description": "DOB: 4/1/15 Tamago is one of the most affectionate, lovebug cats we have ever met. Tamago had it the worst when we trapped him: a very bad upper respiratory infection that made his eyes barely open and his little breath rattle. Even then he was trying to snuggle everyone that came near him and was playful and gentle. He allowed medicine to be administered without so much a whimper. He has recovered fully from his cold (which you can see a bit in one of his photos). Tamago is looking for a good lap to snuggle in, or possibly to just flop on any available inch of you that he can find. Tiny chirping meow and a sweet face with delicate features. Tamago is playful, active, very calm, confident and affectionate. He seems to enjoy watching our older cats through the balcony door, so we think he could get along with most any other cat. Tamago would best be adopted along with a littermate though. He is a wonderful groomer and peace maker of the 'Sushi Kittens' and can not be a solo cat.

Loves to interact through play, especially if he can not get blocked by his brothers from catching the toy. Has a really sweet, slightly grumpy looking face! Miso is gentle and quiet and has made excellent progress coming out of his shell. Would be excellent adopted as a pair with one of his littermates. Loves to snuggle in a pile with them and be groomed by his brothers. Like the other 'Sushi Kittens' he seems to be fond of belly rubs and is very calm being handled (like a the way a ragdoll acts). He has made wonderful strides since he came off the streets of South Gate.

Whether its a game of chasing the feather on a string toy around or chasing after a toy thrown across the room, Toro is a blast. Toro is quite the snuggler, he loves to hop in your lap and roll over to look at you lovingly while you rub his belly and cheeks. He is very confident and will always be the first off the nap-pile to come run and say hi and ask for attention. When people say 'My cat is more like a dog' this is the kind of cat they're talking about! Would be best adopted with one of his littermates (the Sushi Kittens!) since they are not only bonded but play amazingly together. He has shown no destructive tendencies (shredding, clawing) but with such an active demeanor, a playmate is crucial! Is very interested in the older cats in the house, so would also be good for an adult cat that is active and likes to play. Siblings names are: Nori, Tako, Tamago, Miso, Toro.

He was terrified out of his mind, jumping at every sound, but the instant he was in human arms this boy was all purrs. Whatever trauma he went through still lingers as loud noises send him diving for cover and the unknown is a very scary prospect. However, Merlin loves human attention and petting. Pin him down with some pets and he turns on the charm, purring away and even asking for belly rubs! He loves to kiss your fingers when getting pets too! Merlin would do best in a calmer environment, away from loud sudden noises that might remind him of those terrifying days of fireworks. He loves other cats to pieces and takes comfort from their presence. First time he met his foster buddies, he just sat there and let them sniff him all over - not one hiss! Merlin is absolutely adorable with his eye liner and tabby patches. Merlin would do best in a home with adults or mature children as sudden noises and movements are still a bit scary for this sweet boy.

    "description": "DOB: 4/16/15 Sage is part of a rescued cat & kitten community in northeast LA. She and her siblings are a cuddly, playful and loving group of adorable kittens. This girl is very sweet and affectionate, loving and cuddle, while being very playful and funny. She's quite a character, letting out tiny meows to let you know it's time for attention. She has beautiful markings and lovely green eyes, and her fur is super fine and very soft, a real fluffy love-bug for lots of petting, cuddling and hugging. When you pick her up, she melts into your arms and starts purring. When itâs time to play, Sage gets into it like a pro. She loves to run and jump after wand toys and pounce on tiny fur mice or wrestle with her siblings. Sage comes from a big family of Maine Coon, Siamese and Tabby mixes and would love to be adopted with one of her siblings: Sequoia, Manzanita, Juniper & Captain Von Trapp. Spayed, FIV/Felv-free, deflead, dewormed, FVRCP vaccines & microchip. Sage is not declawed and loves to use her cardboard scratcher and sisal tree. Box trained.

    "description": "DOB: 4/27/15 Mariah Kolbe (mnckolbe@gmail.com) Teensy (girl) here! Sugar and spice and everything nice, plus cute and cuddly too! On the morning of April 27th in Pomona California our mama (a stray/feral) gave birth to me and my brother âon-the-runâ for some reason, dropping each one of us in a different location in someoneâs yard. She then just disappeared and never came back for us. The lady of the house discovered us and knew instantly that we needed specialized care if we were to have a chance of survival. She contacted Kitten Rescue and a short time later she delivered us to our foster mom. We were INCREDIBLY tiny at only 2 Â½ and 2 Â¾ oz. but we were fighters! My brother Weensy and I were bottle fed and hand-raised, traveling back and forth to work every day with our foster mom so she could feed us around the clock. With good food in our tummies, a warm snuggly bed, and lots of loving care, we began to thrive. Since weâd gotten so much hands-on attention since birth, weâre very people-oriented, loving, and cuddly. My brother has already found his forever home, but Iâm still waiting for my new family to find me! I love to play, and play, and then play some more . . . . and then find an inviting lap to nap in. I get along great with other kitties of all ages, dogs, and kids too. Since Iâm used to having kitty companionship, itâs important that I go to a home that already has another playful kitty or that I be adopted along with a buddy.

Amelia is a polydactyl, meaning she has an extra toe on all FOUR paws, more unusual than most. It gives her an adorable 'snowshoe' look to her wide-track paws. She is also a budding medium-to-longhair, and there is already evidence that she will be one of those kitties with the long, wild tufts sprouting from her ears, ruff, and other random parts of her delightful little bodyâa bit like Colonel Meow. She is completely at home with most people and cats, and mostly unperturbed by new places and thingsâa very mellow kitty, not the least bit skittish. Loves her lap time, generous with her purring, friendly and affectionate, utterly charming to beholdâshe is destined to become the love of your life.

    "description": "DOB: 5/14/15 Lucretiaâs golden eyes are beautiful, but also expressive, like she is. When Lulu was a tiny infant kitten and her foster mama would move her and her siblings out of their playpen into a kitty carrier when it was playpen-cleaning time, Lucretia, like her siblings, would sometimes mew plaintively when she was picked up off the playpen floor and then put in the carrier. However, she didnât stop mewing when she was safely back on the ground inside the carrier, she kept mewing until all of her siblings were also safely in there with her. She always wanted to make sure all her siblings were safe and that she could see them, which was pretty extraordinary behavior for a four week-old kitten. Sheâs grown into a lovely little girl, who loves to play with toys and with her siblings and other playmates in the house. Sheâs full of energy, but also sweet-natured and snuggly, and loves to be pet and loved on by people. Sheâs pretty perfect :) Luretia is very social, so she needs to be adopted either along with another kitten (ideally a sibling, although that is certainly not a requirement) or to a home where there is already another animal (kitten, adult cat, or cat-loving puppy or adult dog) that would be her full-time playmate.

    "description": "DOB: 5/14/15 This little one is the Miss Congeniality of our household, which is incredible considering that at 4 weeks old, she was one of the most fearful, hostile, and wild little feral kittens her foster parents have ever encountered! They were worried about whether this one would tame, but fortunately little Tullia has turned out to be a first class love-bug with an amazing personality. She is one of those that would be described as very conscious, very present, and totally engaged with her humans. She loves to make eye contact with you, really wants to communicate, and will usually begin to peep out little greetings when she does. She also does fabulous âfloompsâ â sheâll just drop from a standing position to a lying-down position very dramatically, in a way that should have a sound effect â and we imagine âfloompâ would be the sound. Usually when she does this floomping, if youâre not close enough to reach out and pet her, sheâll then slither toward you on her side, purring and purring, until she can get right up to within armâs reach, so that you can pet her while she makes âair biscuitsâ with her paws. She is big on the kneading dough thing, and loves, loves, loves soft blankies and kitty beds. She also seems to have a sense of gentleness and empathy when itâs called for. One of the other kitties in her foster home is an elderly 16 year-old boy who has a lot of health challenges and has been feeling kind of poorly. He loves kittens, but not to play with, just bathing and snuggling, thank-you-very-much. Unlike some of the other youngsters in the household, Tullia seems to sense this, and is very gentle to this sweet old guy, and snuggles up next to him without annoying him. She even will try to give him little baths sometimes, and he returns the favor to her. Tullia is very social, so she needs to be adopted either along with another kitten (ideally a sibling, although that is certainly not a requirement) or to a home where there is already another animal (kitten, adult cat, or cat-loving puppy or adult dog) that would be her full-time playmate.

    "description": "DOB: 4/6/15 Beautiful little Bitsy is just a doll. She is so gentle and sweet that you could almost say that she has a slight shy streak, but her naturally sweet disposition and very playful nature make that shyness easy to overcome â a toy will do it every time. She loves to play with the other kittens in the household, and she also loves to curl up and snuggle with them when playtime is over. That is true with people as well, she loves to stretch out on the bed and rumble away at the end of a long play session. Sheâs naturally curious, but unlike some of her playmates, ahem, she is not destructive in her curiosity â she has what almost seems to be a natural courteousness when it comes to exploring a space, which is really, really refreshing when dealing with a houseful of little ones who are constantly knocking stuff over, pulling things out of boxes, and dragging things around a room. That doesnât mean that she doesnât know how to play hard or do normal kitten things â sheâs just got a little more grace than most. Bitsy is very social, so she needs to be adopted either along with another kitten (ideally a playmate from the household she was raised in, although that is certainly not a requirement) or to a home where there is already another animal (kitten, adult cat, or cat-loving puppy or adult dog) that would be her full-time playmate.

    "description": "DOB: 5/14/15 This is Maximus, who was named ironically due to the fact that he was the runt of his litter. He wasnât just a little smaller, he was about half the size of his largest brother. So, he was given the name Maximus as an aspirational title, so that he would grow big and strong. And, fortunately, Maximus has grown to be a beautiful, strong boy with tons of personality. Even though he has a sister that looks very much like him, and there are some playmates in the house that also strongly resemble him, it isnât hard to pick out Maximus in the room â heâs usually the first one to talk. Being tiny, he learned that if he needed something, he had to speak up! So he doesnât hesitate to tell his foster mom when he needs a little extra food or wants her to help him out of a situation he may have entangled himself in. He loves toys, especially things on strings, and heâll fly through the air to grab them. He is also very affectionate and is a total purr monster. Although this is a family trait, all of his siblings also have purrs that sound like little motors. Maximus is an extremely social little boy, so he needs to be adopted either along with another kitten (ideally a sibling, although that is certainly not a requirement) or to a home where there is already another animal (kitten, adult cat, or cat-loving puppy or adult dog) that would be his full-time playmate.

    "description": "DOB: 5/21/15 Ah, sweet, lovable Valerius. His name means âStrongâ in Latin, and he got that name because he was, without a doubt, the biggest and strongest of his litter. He has continued to remain so, and is larger than both his blood-related siblings, and also most of the other litter of slightly older kittens that he grew up with in his foster home. Valerius is a big, strong, lovable, low-maintenance, silent-type. He is just kind of perfect, really. Heâs handsome, playful, mellow, and just a naturally happy and contented little boy. He loves to play, and plays with any other kitten who is up for a game. His easy-going nature means heâs also buddies with anyone who wants to be buddies â heâll snuggle up with anyone in the household who wants a snuggle buddy. Heâs very playful, but in his heart of hearts, heâs a lover, not a fighter â the gentle giant. (Heâs still a little boy, just big compared to his siblings.) Valerius is very social, so he needs to be adopted either along with another kitten (ideally a sibling, although that is certainly not a requirement) or to a home where there is already another animal (kitten, adult cat, or cat-loving puppy or adult dog) that would be his full-time playmate.

I like hanging out with dogs and other kittens after I get used to them for a few days. I am always looking for the hunt. When I was abandoned on the street I had to be tough so I am always on the alert, and ready to run or fight. I am still a little ruff around the edges but I am willing to learn. My foster mommy even taught me how to sit for a treat, I like those! I am also learning from my fellow foster friend Rosie (kitten) and resident Brody (dog) how to be well mannered.

Nacho is big brother (by about 10 minutes) and is named after his tasty orange coloring. He is extremely friendly and always first to greet you when you come home. Alabama is the baby of the litter and can be a little shy at first but will warm up to you and probably your lap! Together they are a rambunctious ball of activity. Some of their favorite activities include playing hide & seek in postal boxes, wrestling with the resident dog, chasing bits of plastic all around the house and taking luxurious naps. Both kittens are good with: Dogs (great, actually; our pup loves them.) Kids (my nephew made them hats) Other kitties: (but haven't had much exposure...yet) We would like to keep the siblings together if possible as they are rather attached to one another and it would break our hearts to see them part.

    "description": "DOB: 4/10/15 Ladybug here! Iâm a sweet and spunky little brown tabby girl with a heart of gold. Hereâs the story of how I came to be searching for a family to love and cherish me: My sister Snugglebug and I were found abandoned and taken to the East Valley Animal Control facility in mid-April when we were only a day or two old. Kitten Rescue was contacted and our foster mom dropped everything to come rescue us. You see, neonate kittens must be accepted by a recognized rescue organization immediately or theyâre euthanized before the end of the day. Heartbreaking . . . . but true. We were bottle fed and hand-raised, traveling back and forth to work every day for five weeks so our foster mom could feed us around the clock. Since weâve gotten so much hands-on attention since birth, weâre very people-oriented, loving, and cuddly. Weâve both blossomed in foster care! We love to play, and play, and then play some more. Weâve been raised in a home with other kitties (all ages), three kitty-loving dogs, and a 7 year old child whoâs spoiled us rotten since the time we were super tiny. My sister and I are now ready for our own family(s) and forever home(s). While we would love to go to a home together, itâs not a âdeal-breakerâ. If you already have another playful kitty for us to romp and frolic with thatâs fine. However, we would not do well as single kittens as we would greatly miss the kitty companionship and interaction that weâre used to. If you donât already have a kitty companion for us, we must be adopted together.

    "description": "DOB: 5/2/15 Anna 'Banana' is a gorgeous, unique, outgoing, and quirky little Maine Coon Tabby kitten. She gets along with everyone: cats, kittens, non-aggressive dogs, and small children. She is the first to great you at the door, and given the chance, will lay in your lap or sleep cuddled next to you in bed all night long. Originally rescued from the side of the I5 North in Burbank, watching traffic whizz past, she was kept in a toddlerâs room for her first days in foster care. Her toddler roommate enjoyed hugging her and carrying her around like a doll. None of this bothered Anna who is always positive and looking to connect. As a kitten Anna had an inner ear infection caused by polyps. She had to have surgery to remove the polyps and is now better. However, her ear condition may mean that she will have a balance issue and a slight head tilt going forward. Although extremely active and playful, Anna will never be as safe as other cats climbing high up. When being put down on the ground, she sometimes thinks she is falling and will try to flip over and land on her back instead of her feet. Anna is a world-class food snatcher, sometimes door dasher, and finger/ ear-lobe nurser. Her adopters would need to be patient and understanding with these behaviors. That probably translates to mean that they would have previous experience with cats. An extremely entertaining character, Anna is looking for a home where she could have another animal buddy and lots of humans to love.

Not knowing how to properly care for such young kittens, she took us to Pasadena Petco the following morning. As luck would have it Kitten Rescue volunteers were holding their weekly adoption event and we were handed over to someone well versed in the care of neonatal kittens. Soon we were swaddled in a heated blanket and being bottle fed delicious and nutritious fresh goat milk formula. In our foster home weâve been raised with other kitties of all ages, dogs, and a young child too! Having been bottle fed and hand raised, weâre all super used to being held and cuddled. Weâre incredibly affectionate and love to play and interact with people and other critters alike. Weâre now ready for homes and families of our own. We definitely MUST either go to a home that already has another playful kitty to romp and frolic with or we must be adopted in pairs. We would not do well as single kittens, as we would greatly miss the kitty companionship and interaction weâre used to. I would LOVE for you to consider adopting me along with one (or more!) of my siblings Dos-Gato, Tres-Gato and Cuatro-Gato.

    "description": "DOB: 9/4/15 Hello there potential mommy or daddy, My name is Jem and I may be the most awesome kitty youâll ever meet. Or at least thatâs what the people who meet me at adoption events say. I get a lot of compliments on my looks but more importantly on my personality. So many people stop by my cage to play with me, I cause traffic jams at the adoptions! I am a very loving, playful, energetic and outgoing boy who enjoys affection. I like being petted and purr very loudly to show you my appreciation. I am a kitty who gets along well with other boy and girl kitties and who adapts to new environments easily. I love playing with my kitty friends and with my toys. My favorite games are kitty-soccer and trying to catch stringy toys. I was a stray, teeny-tiny kitten all by himself on the streets of Istanbul, Turkey. A nice lady rescued me, brought me to Los Angeles and got me into foster care. I am looking forward to finding my forever home and give you lots of love and happiness.

When puzzled or curious, her tail swishes back and forth, curling like a question mark. She loves playing with her foster sister, Feather, and gets along well with the other older kittens in the house. Since getting Cami each week she has grown more loving and more cuddly too. Her new please is to nap on our laps as we sit on the couch at the end of the day. Please ask any questions or fill out an adoption questionnaire online and we look forward to hearing from you. Cami faithfully uses the litter box and hasn't shown any interest in furniture destruction. Like all Kitten Rescue cats, she comes microchipped, vaccinated, spayed, dewormed, and defleaed.

I scare easily so am not good with small kids or being put outside. My favorite toy is a mouse in a tunnel which I can't quite get hold of although I try until I am disgusted with the stupid little rat. My foster momma says I am gray and white with a few faint tiger stripes showing. I have a very handsome face with very big ears. I would like to find a home with my sister if I can.

She loves attention and gets along great with other animals (including dogs!) and would be fine with kids. Her adoption fee includes her spay. FeLV test, vaccines, and microchip. Her adoption fee is $110, but if you adopt her with one of her siblings we will discount the total adoption fee to $200. She and her siblings are looking for indoor only homes.

All of my kitty family and friends got rescued from the restaurant but nobody knew about me and I almost got left behind!! Luckily, on the very last night before B/G closed, I crept out onto the awning over the main walkway and the valet saw me. He called the rescue folks and they came and got me so now Iâm much happier, and not starving like I was. And I need a permanent, loving home; I am still getting used to being around people and am still scared some of the time. I am also very friendly and I purr a lot when you pet me. I think I get along fine with other cats, I am neutered and have started my vaccinations.

I am a talker but I am not that loud aka a âquite roarâ. I love treats, being pet, playing and looking out the window. I am not a lap kitty but I will sit on the couch right next to you and watch whatever you watch. I have a big motor and am easily made happy. If you say may name I will come running over for love. \n\nI am current on all my vaccinations, micro chipped, combo tested (neg/neg), potty trained, I would prefer to live as a single kitty. I have all the traits of an amazing forever friend and would love a home of my own.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please fill out an application! I would love to meet you.",

Little Pip had some challenges the first couple days of her life, one of them being her 2 brothers, who were twice the size of her. She also had a hard time getting to mom to eat with all the other kittens piled onto of her. But she seemed to always figure out a way to get in and eat. Today, Pip is still a tiny girl but is growing fast. She has big eyes and big ears. She loves to play with her siblings but also will sit back and watch. Pip would do great in most any household.",

I am a handsome Marbled Bengal mix, born March 18, 2015. <br><br>I was going to be relinquished to a vet clinic along with my brother Dallas, Sister Cheyenne and our mom. The vet clinic call a rescue, that I now call my temporary home, and they came and got us right away. Our former family decided to keep our mom (rescue helped them get her spayed).   Once we were 8 weeks, we went to our first adoption event. That is were we met our foster mom! She told us that she fell in love with our precious faces. With all of us in tow, we when to our new foster home. We met so many new friends and learned to like doggies. <br><br>We have been in foster care for about 8 months now still looking for our forever family. Well, only my brother Dallas and I are. Our sister Cheyenne was recently adopted to an amazing family who loves her so much! We are so happy for her but are still thinking about the day we get our new family. \n\nI am a very sweet and rambunctious boy who loves to run around and have fun. I love belly rubs and purring for days. I love climbing cat trees, and playing with my foster friends. I am an overall goofy boy who is looking for a home that will fit all my wild antics.  \n\nI am neutered, up to date on all my shots, combo tested (neg/neg) and potty trained. I would do best in a home with another kitty or with a family that is home to play with me. \n\nIf you are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application. I cant wait to meet you!",

I like to take long naps, sometimes on my foster Momâs lap and I just purr and purr. She calls me her petite princess. I am now ready for my forever home and hope I get to go with another one of my brothers or another kitten so that I will always have a playmate.",

    "description": "Brandy - Female Fluffy Tuxedo - DOB: 4/25/15<br><br>My story has a sad beginning, but I am hoping for a Happily Ever After!\nI was found in a gutter days after being hit by a car. My front right leg had already begun to heal on it's own but with some irreparable damage. I have a permanent limp (my foster mom thinks I look like a bunny when I run across the room) but it does not slow me down, I can get to the top of the cat tower faster than any of my foster kitty siblings! \nAfter a month in the hospital, my foster mom brought me home and I am slowly learning to trust people again. Anytime anyone picked me up at the hospital it was to give me a painful shot or yucky medicine. I learned to associate being touched with getting medicine or a shot. I would growl and hiss anytime my foster mom tried to pet or hug me. With a lot of time and patience she has showed me that not all people are bad. I am still skittish at times, but I have learned that people really do give the best pets. I especially love butt rubs and chin scratches!\nI really love cat towers. I prefer the ones that have the cubbies so I can crawl in there and take a good nap, I feel safe when its enclosed. I enjoy playing with my foster kitty siblings and can keep up with them just fine even with my bum leg.\nI'm looking for someone who can be patient with me. I have the potential to be a snuggle bug if someone is willing to earn my trust. It will be a slow process in the beginning so I need someone who won't give up on me. I live happily with other kitties and dogs. I don't really know how I am with kids since I'm still a little scared of people. I might get along better with older kids who know what it will take to be friends with me. I really just want love, I'm realizing that I can receive a lot of love from people so I hope there is someone out there who will love me.\nIf you are interested in meeting me or have specific questions, please contact Kathy at 714-745-8060 respond to this ad or meet me in person this Saturday at PetCo Buena Park, corner of Valley View and Ball Road.",

They play all day long and seem to have no trouble with monocular vision.  Would love for them to go together as Blinky is a shy girl and her sister helps give her confidence.
